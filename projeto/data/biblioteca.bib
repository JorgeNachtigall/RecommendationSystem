abstract = {Abstract In a context characterized by a growing demand for networked services, users of advanced applications sometimes face network performance troubles that may actually prevent them from completing their tasks. Therefore, providing assistance for user communities that have difficulties using the network has been identified as one of the major issues of performance-related support activities. Despite the advances network management has made over the last years, there is a lack of guidance services to provide users with information that goes beyond merely presenting network properties. In this light, the research community has been highlighting the importance of User-Perceived Quality (UPQ) scores during the evaluation of network services for network applications, such as Quality of Experience (QoE) and Mean Opinion Score (MOS). However, despite their potential to assist end-users to deal with network performance troubles, only few types of network applications have well established UPQ scores. Besides that, they are defined through experiments essentially conducted in laboratory, rather than actual usage. This paper thus presents a knowledge and Collaboration-based Network Users{\textquoteright} Support (CNUS) Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) Process that predicts UPQ scores to assist users by focusing on the collaboration among them through the sharing of their experiences in using network applications. It builds (i) a knowledge base that includes not only information about network performance problems, but also applications{\textquoteright} characteristics, (ii) a case base that contains users{\textquoteright} opinions, and (iii) a user database that stores users{\textquoteright} profiles. By processing them, CNUS benefits users through the indication of the degree of satisfaction they may achieve based on the general opinion from members of their communities in similar contexts. In order to evaluate the suitability of CNUS, a CBR system was built and validated through an experimental study conducted in laboratory with a multi-agent system that simulated scenarios where users request for assistance. The simulation was supported by an ontology of network services and applications and reputation scheme implemented through the PageRank algorithm. The results of the study pointed to the effectiveness of CNUS, and its resilience to users{\textquoteright} collusive and incoherent behaviors. Besides that, they showed the influence of the knowledge about network characteristics, users{\textquoteright} profiles and application features on computer-based support activities.},

abstract = {Web 2.0 users need usable mechanisms for sharing their content with each other in a controlled manner across boundaries of content-hosting or application-service providers (CSPs). In this paper, we describe the architecture, design, and implementation of a proposed system for Web 2.0 content sharing across CSPs. With our approach, users use their existing email account to login to CSPs, and content owners use their email-based contact-lists to specify access policies. Users are assumed to be equipped only with a Web browser and CSPs do not need to change their existing access-control mechanisms. In addition, policy statements are URI-addressable, and the same access policies can be reused and enforced across CSPs.},

abstract = {Abstract HealthNet (HN) is a social network that brings together patients with similar health conditions. HN helps users in finding a solution to their health problems by suggesting doctors and health facilities that best fit the patient profile. Indeed, the core component of HN is a recommender system that suggests patients similar to the target user and supports the choice of the doctor and the hospital for a specific condition. The recommendation algorithm first computes similarities among patients, and then generates a ranked list of doctors and hospitals for a given patient profile by exploiting health data shared by the community. The HN typical user can find the most similar patients, can look how they treated their diseases, and can receive suggestions for solving her condition. In order to facilitate the interaction with the system and improve the recommendation step, the patient can express her health status by a natural-language sentence. The system analyzes the sentence and identifies the most relevant medical area (e.g., orthopedics, neurology, allergology, etc.) for that specific case, and uses this information for the recommendation task. Currently HN is in alpha version and only for Italian users, but in the future we want to extend the platform to other languages. We carried out both an in-vitro experimental evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the module for analyzing natural language descriptions provided by users as well as the recommender system to suggest the right doctors for a specific health problem, and an in-vivo evaluation performed by real doctors. Results are really encouraging.},

abstract = {Abstract Traditional approaches for research project selection by government funding agencies mainly focus on the matching of research relevance by keywords or disciplines. Other research relevant information such as social connections (e.g., collaboration and co-authorship) and productivity (e.g., quality, quantity, and citations of published journal articles) of researchers is largely ignored. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a social network-empowered research analytics framework (RAF) for research project selections. Scholarmate.com, a professional research social network with easy access to research relevant information, serves as a platform to build researcher profiles from three dimensions, i.e., relevance, productivity and connectivity. Building upon profiles of both proposals and researchers, we develop a unique matching algorithm to assist decision makers (e.g. panel chairs or division managers) in optimizing the assignment of reviewers to research project proposals. The proposed framework is implemented and tested by the largest government funding agency in China to aid the grant proposal evaluation process. The new system generated significant economic benefits including great cost savings and quality improvement in the proposal evaluation process.},

abstract = {Learning object metadata aims at describing educational resources in order to allow better reusability and retrieval. Unfortunately, annotating complete courses thoroughly with LOM metadata can be a tedious task. We show how additional inference rules can make this task easier, and allow us to derive additional metadata from existing ones. Additionally, using these rules as integrity constraints helps us to define the constraints on LOM fields, thus taking an important step towards a complete axiomatization of LOM metadata (with the goal of transforming the LOM definitions from a simple syntactical description into a complete ontology). We used RDF metadata descriptions and an inference language explicitly developed for RDF (TRIPLE) to represent metadata and axioms.

abstract = {Abstract Data warehouses and On-Line Analytical Processing tools, OLAP, together permit a multi-dimensional analysis of structured data information. However, as business systems are increasingly required to handle substantial quantities of unstructured textual information, the need arises for an effective and similar means of analysis. To manage unstructured text data stored in data warehouses, a new multi-dimensional analysis model is proposed that includes textual measures as well as a topic hierarchy. In this model, the textual measures that associate the topics with the text documents are generated by Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis, while the hierarchy is created automatically using a clustering algorithm. Documents are then able to be queried using OLAP tools. The model was evaluated from two viewpoints {\textemdash} query execution time and user satisfaction. Evaluation of execution time was carried out on scientific articles using two query types and user satisfaction (with query time and ease of use) using statistical frequency and multivariate analyses. Encouraging observations included that as the number of documents increases, query time increases as a lineal, rather than exponential tendency. In addition, the model gained an increasing acceptance with use, while the visualization of the model was also well received by users.},

This calls for specialized recommender systems, often in a form of electronic program guides, which should provide unobtrusive assistance. In this paper, we analyze such recommender system design under the broadcast scenario, where uplink connection to the network center is not available. We put special emphasis on user modeling algorithm that would be able to efficiently learn the user's interests. Our proposal applies the elements of machine learning and pattern recognition, as well as the information retrieval theory, like vector spaces and cluster hypothesis. The derived algorithm is computationally simple, while experimental results show high acceptance ratio of the proposed recommendations.},

abstract = {Abstract Many efforts in the area of computer security have been drawn to attribute-based access control (ABAC). Compared to other adopted models, ABAC provides more granularity, scalability, and flexibility. This makes it a valuable access control system candidate for securing platforms and environments used for coordination and cooperation among organizations and communities, especially over open networks such as the Internet. On the other hand, the basic ABAC model lacks provisions for context, trust and privacy issues, all of which are becoming increasingly critical, particularly in high performance distributed collaboration environments. This paper presents an extended access control model based on attributes associated with objects and subjects. It incorporates trust and privacy issues in order to make access control decisions sensitive to the cross-organizational collaboration context. Several aspects of the proposed model are implemented and illustrated by a case study that shows realistic ABAC policies in the domain of distributed multiple organizations crisis management systems. Furthermore, the paper shows a collaborative graphical tool that enables the actors in the emergency management system to make better decisions. The prototype shows how it guarantees the privacy of object{\textquoteright}s attributes, taking into account the trust of the subjects. This tool incorporates a decision engine that relies on attribute based policies and dynamic trust and privacy evaluation. The resulting platform demonstrates the integration of the ABAC model, the evolving context, and the attributes of actors and resources.},

Recommender algorithms can be used to make smart decisions in complex information systems and help the users decide upon useful materials; therefore, they become a promising area in academia and industry. The current paper presents a survey on educational recommender systems (RS): a set of analysis criteria are exposed and the technological specifications and challenges of each analysed system are provided, in the context of the main trends in the development of RS. Also, an ontology-based educational recommendation mechanism is proposed and its application to lifelong learning is highlighted, proving that RS can successfully support new learning paradigms.},

abstract = {Abstract The popularity of smartphones, coupled with the amount of valuable and private information they hold, make them attractive to attackers interested in exploiting the devices to harvest sensitive information. Exploiting human vulnerabilities (i.e., social engineering) is an approach widely used to achieve this goal. Improving the security awareness of users is an effective method for mitigating social engineering attacks. However, while in the domain of personal computers (PCs) the security awareness of users is relatively high, previous studies have shown that for the mobile platform, the security awareness level is significantly lower. The skills required from a mobile user to interact safely with his/her smartphone are different from those that are required for safe and responsible PC use. Therefore, the awareness of mobile users to security risks is an important aspect of information security. An essential and challenging requirement of assessing security awareness is the definition of measureable criteria for a security aware user. In this paper, we present a hierarchical taxonomy for security awareness, specifically designed for mobile device users. The taxonomy defines a set of measurable criteria that are categorized according to different technological focus areas (e.g., applications and browsing) and within the context of psychological dimensions (e.g., knowledge, attitude, and behavior). We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed taxonomy by introducing an expert-based procedure for deriving mobile security awareness models for different attack classes (each class is an aggregation of social engineering attacks that exploit a similar set of human vulnerabilities). Each model reflects the contribution (weight) of each criteria to the mitigation of the corresponding attack class. Application of the proposed procedure, based on the input of 17 security experts, to derive mobile security awareness models of four different attack classes, confirms that the skills required from a smartphone user to mitigate an attack are different for different attack classes.},

abstract = {In financial markets, abnormal trading behaviors pose a serious challenge to market surveillance and risk management. What is worse, there is an increasing emergence of abnormal trading events that some experienced traders constitute a collusive clique and collaborate to manipulate some instruments, thus mislead other investors by applying similar trading behaviors for maximizing their personal benefits. In this paper, a method is proposed to detect the potential collusive cliques involved in an instrument of future markets by first calculating the correlation coefficient between any two eligible unified aggregated time series of signed order volume, and then combining the connected components from multiple sparsified weighted graphs constructed by using the correlation matrices where each correlation coefficient is over a user-specified threshold. Experiments conducted on real order data from the Shanghai Futures Exchange show that the proposed method can effectively detect suspect collusive cliques, which have been verified by financial experts. A tool based on the proposed method has been deployed in the exchange as a pilot application for futures market surveillance and risk management.},

abstract = {Abstract Personalization in information systems can be considered beneficial but also ethically and socially harmful. Like many other technologies, the uptake of personalization has been rapid, with inadequate consideration given to its effects. Personalization in e-learning systems also has potential for both harmful and beneficial outcomes, but less is known about its effects. The ethical and social hazards include privacy compromise, lack of control, reduced individual capability, and the commodification of education. Personalization is appearing in many systems already; thus, these hazards may already be occurring. Solutions, more research and community discussion of the issues are needed.},

abstract = {Abstract Social media websites, such as YouTube and Flicker, are currently gaining in popularity. A large volume of information is generated by online users and how to appropriately provide personalized content is becoming more challenging. Traditional recommendation models are overly dependent on preference ratings and often suffer from the problem of {\textquotedblleft}data sparsity{\textquotedblright}. Recent research has attempted to integrate sentiment analysis results of online affective texts into recommendation models; however, these studies are still limited. The one class collaborative filtering (OCCF) method is more applicable in the social media scenario yet it is insufficient for item recommendation. In this study, we develop a novel sentiment-aware social media recommendation framework, referred to as SA_OCCF, in order to tackle the above challenges. We leverage inferred sentiment feedback information and OCCF models to improve recommendation performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a real social media web site to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework and methods. The results show that the proposed methods are effective in improving the performance of the baseline OCCF methods.},

An ontology is used as a backbone to the system in the proposed architecture to represent the problem domain, while multiple web services are orchestrated to compose a suitable recommendation model, matching the current recommendation context at run-time. In order to allow for such dynamic behaviour, the proposed system tackles the recommendation problem by applying existing RS techniques on three different levels: the selection of appropriate sets of features, recommendation model and recommendable items.},

For instance, Amazon.com maintains an entire plethora of hand-crafted taxonomies classifying books, movies, apparel and various other types of consumer goods. We use such taxonomic background knowledge for the computation of personalized recommendations, exploiting relationships between super-concepts and sub-concepts during profile generation. Empirical analysis, both offline and online, demonstrates our proposal's superiority over existing approaches when user information is sparse and implicit ratings prevail. Besides addressing the sparsity issue, we use parts of our taxonomy-based recommender framework for balancing and diversifying personalized recommendation lists in order to reflect the user's complete spectrum of interests. Though being detrimental to average accuracy, we show that our method improves user satisfaction with recommendation lists, in particular for lists generated using the common item-based collaborative filtering algorithm. We evaluate our method using book recommendation data, including offline analysis on 361,349 ratings and an online study involving more than 2,100 subjects.},

abstract = {Abstract Adaptive applications may benefit from having models of users' personality to adapt their behavior accordingly. There is a wide variety of domains in which this can be useful, i.e., assistive technologies, e-learning, e-commerce, health care or recommender systems, among others. The most commonly used procedure to obtain the user personality consists of asking the user to fill in questionnaires. However, on one hand, it would be desirable to obtain the user personality as unobtrusively as possible, yet without compromising the reliability of the model built. On the other hand, our hypothesis is that users with similar personality are expected to show common behavioral patterns when interacting through virtual social networks, and that these patterns can be mined in order to predict the tendency of a user personality. With the goal of inferring personality from the analysis of user interactions within social networks, we have developed TP2010, a Facebook application. It has been used to collect information about the personality traits of more than 20,000 users, along with their interactions within Facebook. Based on all the collected data, automatic classifiers were trained by using different machine-learning techniques, with the purpose of looking for interaction patterns that provide information about the users' personality traits. These classifiers are able to predict user personality starting from parameters related to user interactions, such as the number of friends or the number of wall posts. The results show that the classifiers have a high level of accuracy, making the proposed approach a reliable method for predicting the user personality},

With the advent of the Social Web and the growing popularity of Social Networks, where users explicitly provide personal information and interact with others and the system, it is becoming clear that the key for the success of recommendations is to develop new strategies which focus on social recommendations leveraged by these new sources of knowledge. In our work, we focus on group recommender systems. These systems traditionally suffer from a number of shortcomings that hamper their effectiveness. In this paper we continue our research, that focuses on improving the overall quality of group recommendations through the addition of social knowledge to existing recommendation strategies. To do so, we use the information stored in Social Networks to elicit social factors following two approaches: the cognitive modeling approach, that studies how people{\textquoteright}s way of thinking predisposes their actions; and the social approach, that studies how people{\textquoteright}s relationships predispose their actions. We show the value of using models of social cognition extracted from Social Networks in group recommender systems through the instantiation of our model into a real-life Facebook movie recommender application.},

This research is driven by pedagogical as well as technological disciplines. The most challenging ideas are currently found in the application of mobile, ubiquitous, pervasive, contextualized and seamless technologies for education, which we shall refer to as pervasive education. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the existing work in this field and categorizes it with respect to educational settings. Using this approach, best practice solutions for certain educational settings and open questions for pervasive education are highlighted in order to inspire interested developers and educators. The work is assigned to different fields, identified by the main pervasive technologies used and the educational settings. Based on these assignments we identify areas within pervasive education that are currently disregarded or deemed challenging so that further research and development in these fields are stimulated in a trans-disciplinary approach.},

abstract = {Abstract Computer Supported Collaborative Blended Learning (CSCBL) scripts are innovative practices that benefit from interactive devices to combine and coordinate activities occurring in different spatial locations. However, the adoption of CSCBL scripts is hindered by the difficulties in orchestration that they entail for practitioners. As observed in a concrete experiment, these orchestration problems include: adapting group formation according to students{\textquoteright} actions in previous activities, supporting transitions between activities and artifacts across locations using diverse technologies, or displaying the appropriate tools to students depending on their group and assigned task. This paper describes the technological support designed to alleviate this complexity. The result is a Computer Supported Collaborative Blended Learning (CSCBL) script and its associated orchestration system that allows the replication of these practices at a minimum cost. The CSCBL script has been evaluated in a case study with 35 students and 5 teachers. Based on this orchestration system and the findings of the experiment, we also propose an architecture based on IMS Learning Design and Generic Service Integration in combination with other web based tools to support the enactment of other similar CSCBL scripts. The findings of this experiment offer interesting insights into the extend to which different technologies and multiple spaces can be combined for orchestrating integrated complex collaborative practices.},

Interested individuals can contribute to such systems by selecting among a wide range of open tasks. Arguing that current approaches are suboptimal in terms of matching tasks and contributors' individual interests and capabilities, this article advocates the introduction of personalized task recommendation mechanisms. We contribute to a conceptual foundation for the design of such mechanisms by conducting a systematic review of the corresponding academic literature. Based on the insights derived from this analysis, we identify a number of issues for future research. In particular, our findings highlight the need for more significant empirical results through large-scale online experiments, an improved dialog with mainstream recommender systems research, and the integration of various sources of knowledge that exceed the boundaries of individual systems.},

A group recommender is more appropriate and useful for domains in which several people participate in a single activity, as is often the case with movies and restaurants. We present an analysis of the primary design issues for group recommenders, including questions about the nature of groups, the rights of group members, social value functions for groups, and interfaces for displaying group recommendations. We then report on our PolyLens prototype and the lessons we learned from usage logs and surveys from a nine-month trial that included 819 users We found that users not only valued group recommendations, but were willing to yield some privacy to get the benefits of group recommendations Users valued an extension to the group recommender system that enabled them to invite non-members to participate, via email},

On one hand, technology enables retailers to improve their services to customers, to improve their management operations and reduce their cost as well. On the other hand, technology brings some benefits to consumers related to short lines at checkouts, higher speed in providing services in the store, no pricing errors, loyalty card programmes, etc. The main purpose of the paper is to discuss the benefits and limitations of technology in retailing in general. For the purpose of getting better insight into the importance of new technological solutions for retailers and consumers, different areas of technology in retailing have been explored in the selected retail context of the Republic of Croatia. The findings of the two-phase study, including a qualitative and a quantitative approach, suggest that innovative technology help consumers to make their shopping decisions, while better understanding of consumer goals and related stored information in turn would help retailers to develop successful retail strategy.},

As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of social tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and evaluated two enhancements of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on Cite ULike, a social tagging service for scientific articles. The result obtained after two phases of evaluation suggests that both enhancements are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms, as we do in our NwCF approach, leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 similarity measure, an alternative to Pearson correlation for calculating the similarity between users and their neighbors, increases the coverage of the recommendation process.},

In recent times, the task of finding and recommending a list of learning objects that fits the specific user{\textquoteright}s needs and requirements is a very active area of research. In this regard, this paper proposes DELPHOS, a framework to assist users in the search for learning objects in repositories and which shows an example of application in engineering. LORs can be used in engineering not only for learning and training for students, instructors and professionals but also for sharing knowledge about engineering problems and projects. The proposed approach is based on a weighted hybrid recommender that uses different filtering or recommendation criteria. The values of these weights can be assigned by the user him/herself or can be automatically calculated by the system in an adaptive and dynamic way. This paper describes the architecture and interface of DELPHOS and shows some experiments with a group of 24 civil engineering students in order to evaluate and validate the usefulness of this tool.},

However, service developers have faced a dilemma of balancing between making the service as high quality as possible but at the same time creating demand for the premium products that augment the core free service. If the service is of enough high quality, augmenting premium products might not offer significant added value over the otherwise free service. In this study we investigate how perceived service quality predicts customers{\textquoteright} willingness to continue using the freemium services and to purchase premium content. User responses were gathered from freemium services (free-to-play games) (N = 869). The results indicate that while expectedly the different dimensions of service quality (assurance, empathy, reliability and responsiveness) positively predict the intentions to continue using the freemium service, they do directly predict why people would be willing to spend more money on premium, i.e. the effect of perceived quality of a freemium service on premium purchases is mediated by use of freemium. These findings indicate that increasing the quality of a freemium service has surprisingly little effect on the demand for additional premium services directly.},

Proactive recommenders are a good example because they push recommendations to the user when the current situation seems appropriate, without explicit user request. Evaluating whether users would accept proactive recommendations, how to properly notify them and how to present recommended items are important research questions. In this article, we present the scenario related to a context-aware restaurant recommender for Android smartphones. Two options to achieve proactivity have been designed: a widget- and a notification-based solution. In addition, our mobile user interface includes a visualization of recommended items and allows for user feedback. The approach was evaluated in a survey among users with good results regarding usefulness and effectiveness. The results also showed that test users preferred the widget-based solution in terms of user experience.},

abstract = {Abstract Online social networks have received a dramatic increase of interest in the last decade due to the growth of Internet and Web 2.0. They are among the most popular sites on the Internet that are being used in almost all areas of life including education, medical, entertainment, business, and telemarketing. Unfortunately, they have become primary targets for malicious users who attempt to perform illegal activities and cause harm to other users. The unusual behavior of such users can be identified by using anomaly detection techniques. Anomaly detection in social networks refers to the problem of identifying the strange and unexpected behavior of users by exploring the patterns hidden in the networks, as the patterns of interaction of such users deviate significantly from the normal users of the networks. Even though a multitude of anomaly detection methods have been developed for different problem settings, this field is still relatively young and rapidly growing. Hence, there is a growing need for an organized study of the work done in the area of anomaly detection in social networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of a large set of methods for mining social networks for anomalies by providing a multi-level taxonomy to categorize the existing techniques based on the nature of input network, the type of anomalies they detect, and the underlying anomaly detection approach. In addition, this paper highlights the various application scenarios where these methods have been used, and explores the research challenges and open issues in this field.},

abstract = {This thesis describes an investigation into the practical use of ontologies for the development of information systems. Ontologies are formal descriptions of shared knowledge in a domain. An ontology can be used as a specification of an information system because it specifies the knowledge that is required for the tasks the information system has to perform. Sharing and reuse of ontologies across different domains and applications can therefore improve information systems design. Ontologies have been a subject for a lot of research carried out in the artificial intelligence community. Although many ontologies have been developed, they fail to demonstrate that ontologies for large and complex domains can be developed that can be used and reused across different applications. There are three reasons for this: (i) many ontologies have not been used to develop a real-life application, (ii) many ontologies have not been reused for different applications in different domains and (iii)many ontologies are merely taxonomies of domain concepts and fail to capture meta-level and tacit background knowledge. },

In this paper television programs come from various online video web sites that a user has registered in are watched at different time. The article describes the approach to such services based on HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and FOAF project.

abstract = {Abstract Display and search ads are the most popular Internet ad formats. Instead of being placed on search engine result pages, display ads are placed on webpages that include more actual content. In order to improve online contextual advertising, the effects of webpage content on embedded display ads must be understood. This study investigates how viewers{\textquoteright} attitudes toward content and the applicability of that content to the adjacent display ads impact the effectiveness of those ads. The moderating effects of viewers{\textquoteright} attention and need for cognition are also examined. The experimental results show that webpage content automatically activates ad evaluations, and that this effect increases when viewers pay less attention to the ad or have a high need for cognition. If the webpage content is highly applicable to the ad, improvements are seen in the attitude toward the ad and the attitude toward the brand.},

Content based recommender systems (CB-RSs) offer personalized recommendations to a user mainly based on his past history and representations of the items. Although CB-RSs have been applied successfully in various domains, however recommendation diversity, representation of items as well as users{\textquoteright} modeling are still major concerns. Our work in this paper is an attempt towards developing effective content based filtering (CBF) by introducing an item representation scheme, fuzzy similarity measures and incorporating collaborative diverse predictions for alleviating its recommendation diversity. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid scheme Fuzzy-CF-CBF outperforms hybrid CF-CBF, as well as both the fuzzy collaborative filtering (Fuzzy-CF) and the fuzzy content based filtering (Fuzzy-CBF).},

abstract = {Abstract The central purpose of this survey is to provide readers an insight into the recent advances and challenges in on-line active learning. Active learning has attracted the data mining and machine learning community since around 20 years. This is because it served for important purposes to increase practical applicability of machine learning techniques, such as (i) to reduce annotation and measurement costs for operators and measurement equipments, (ii) to reduce manual labeling effort for experts and (iii) to reduce computation time for model training. Almost all of the current techniques focus on the classical pool-based approach, which is off-line by nature as iterating over a pool of (unlabeled) reference samples a multiple times to choose the most promising ones for improving the performance of the classifiers. This is achieved by (time-intensive) re-training cycles on all labeled samples available so far. For the on-line, stream mining case, the challenge is that the sample selection strategy has to operate in a fast, ideally single-pass manner. Some first approaches have been proposed during the last decade (starting from around 2005) with the usage of machine learning (ML) oriented incremental classifiers, which are able to update their parameters based on selected samples, but not their structures. Since 2012, on-line active learning concepts have been proposed in connection with the paradigm of evolving models, which are able to expand their knowledge into feature space regions so far unexplored. This opened the possibility to address a particular type of uncertainty, namely that one which stems from a significant novelty content in streams, as, e.g., caused by drifts, new operation modes, changing system behaviors or non-stationary environments. We will provide an overview about the concepts and techniques for sample selection and active learning within these two principal major research lines (incremental ML models versus evolving systems), a comparison of their essential characteristics and properties (raising some advantages and disadvantages), and a study on possible evaluation techniques for them. We conclude with an overview of real-world application examples where various on-line AL approaches have been already successfully applied in order to significantly reduce user{\textquoteright}s interaction efforts and costs for model updates.},

Research in this area has largely focused on quantitative ratings provided on websites. However, advanced techniques for linguistic analysis provide the opportunity to extract meaning from the valuable comments provided by visitors. In this paper, we identify the key dimensions of customer service voiced by hotel visitors use a data mining approach, latent dirichlet analysis (LDA). The big data set includes 266,544 online reviews for 25,670 hotels located in 16 countries. LDA uncovers 19 controllable dimensions that are key for hotels to manage their interactions with visitors. We also find differences according to demographic segments. Perceptual mapping further identifies the most important dimensions according to the star-rating of hotels. We conclude with the implications of our study for future research and practice.},

A diverse pattern of decreases and increases in income inequality has emerged in parallel with increasing fixed and mobile connectivity. Building on earlier research, this paper develops a socio-technical model to examine the contribution of hyperconnectivity to these outcomes. ICTs rarely are a single cause but interact with other technological, economic, and political forces to shape the extent of income inequality. Depending on the constellation of these factors, income inequality may decrease or increase. Public policy may be able to ameliorate undesirable outcomes although effective programs will typically require initiatives that go beyond traditional measures designed to reduce digital divides.},

abstract = {Abstract With the rapid proliferation of online information, how to find useful information, such as suitable jobs, appropriate experts, and proper projects, is really an important problem. Recommendation technique, as one of emerging tools to deal with information overload and information asymmetry, is critically important for providing personalized online information services. With the increase of R{\&}amp;D investment in government and industry, such as high-tech companies and advanced manufacturing enterprises, more and more R{\&}amp;D project information are launched in public websites for cooperation. When the number of online information and users is extremely huge, how to effectively recommend R{\&}amp;D project opportunities to related researchers and practitioners is a challenging and complex task. In this paper, a novel two-stage method is proposed for R{\&}amp;D project opportunity recommendation. An information filtering method is first offered to identity proper R{\&}amp;D projects as a candidate set. Then, an information aggregation model with various constraints is suggested to recommend appropriate R{\&}amp;D projects for applicants. The proposed method has been implemented in an online research community {\textendash} ScholarMate (www.scholarmate.com). An online user study has been conducted and the evaluation results exhibit that the proposed method is more effective than existing ones.},

This paper presents a method for the analysis of occurrences of pairs and groups of species that aims to identify patterns in co-occurrences through the application of association rules of data mining. We propose, implement and evaluate a tool to help ecologists formulate and validate hypotheses regarding co-occurrence between two or more species. To validate our approach, we analyzed the occurrence of species with a dataset from the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Project on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). Three case studies were developed based on this tropical forest to evaluate patterns of positive and negative correlation. Our tool can be used to point co-occurrence in a multi-scale form and for multi-species, simultaneously, accelerating the identification process for the Spatial Point Pattern Analysis. This paper demonstrates that data mining, which has been used successfully in applications such as business and consumer profile analysis, can be a useful resource in ecology.},

The most important feature of NFPR is its flexibility, that allows teachers to create their own set of pedagogical rules. The proposed model has been implemented and tested with simulated data.

Unfortunately, limited tools are available to address such needs and reduce users' workload on managing their social relationships. To tackle this issue, we propose an approach to facilitate online social network users to group their contacts into social circles with common interests. Further, we leverage the social group practice to automate the privacy setting process for users who add new contacts or upload new data items. We evaluate our approach using real-world data collected through a user study. The study also includes an analysis of the properties that are most critical for privacy related decisions.},

The CBR perspective is shaped by studies of human cognition, but the resulting approach has proved effective for developing applied intelligent systems in a wide range of domains.

abstract = {Web 2.0 users need usable mechanisms for sharing their content with each other in a controlled manner across boundaries of content-hosting or application-service providers (CSPs). In this paper, we describe the architecture, design, and implementation of a proposed system for Web 2.0 content sharing across CSPs. With our approach, users use their existing email account to login to CSPs, and content owners use their email-based contact-lists to specify access policies. Users are assumed to be equipped only with a Web browser and CSPs do not need to change their existing access-control mechanisms. In addition, policy statements are URI-addressable, and the same access policies can be reused and enforced across CSPs.},

abstract = {In the era of social media there are now many different ways that a scientist can build their public profile; the publication of high-quality scientific papers being just one. While social media is a valuable tool for outreach and the sharing of ideas, there is a danger that this form of communication is gaining too high a value and that we are losing sight of key metrics of scientific value, such as citation indices. To help quantify this, I propose the 'Kardashian Index', a measure of discrepancy between a scientist's social media profile and publication record based on the direct comparison of numbers of citations and Twitter followers.},

abstract = {Abstract The ability to predict what university course a student may select has important quality assurance and economic imperatives. The capacity to determine future course load and student interests provides for increased accuracy in the allocation of resources including curriculum and learning support and career counselling services. Prior research in data mining has identified several models that can be applied to predict course selection based on the data residing in institutional information systems. However, these models only aim to predict the total number of students that may potentially enrol in a course. This prior work has not examined the prediction of the course enrolments with respect to the specific academic term and year in which the students will take those courses in the future. Moreover, these prior models operate under the assumption that all data stored within institutional information systems can be directly associated with an individual student's identity. This association with student identity is not always feasible due to government regulations (e.g., student evaluations of teaching and courses). In this paper, we propose an approach for extracting student preferences from sources available in institutional student information systems. The extracted preferences are analysed using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), to predict student course selection. The AHP-based approach was validated on a dataset collected in an undergraduate degree program at a Canadian research-intensive university (N = 1061). The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the student course predictions was high and equivalent to that of previous data mining approaches using fully identifiable data. The findings suggest that a students' grade point average relative to the grades of the courses they are considering for enrolment was the most important factor in determining future course selections. This finding is consistent with theories of modern counseling psychology that acknowledges self-efficacy as a critical factor in career planning.},

However, personalization approaches in the design and development stage of Marketing-IS have not been widely studied in the End-User Development (EUD) research area. The lack of such research studies results in the development of Marketing-IS tools that neglect the differences in the end-user behavior, and artifacts of low performance and reusability. Attempting to figure out how end-users can participate in the design and construction of Marketing-IS in an efficient way, research suggests the {\textquoteleft}construction{\textquoteright} of end- users behavioral profiles based on human factors. Recent evidence reveal that human factors such as gender and expertise level can influence and even determine the end-users{\textquoteright}, behavior, and consequently performance, while end-users interact with EUD environments. This paper presents a methodological approach in which we identify different behavioral user-profiles, named {\textquoteleft}user-categories{\textquoteright} based on behavioural attributes derived by the human factors of gender and expertise level. The resulting user- categories can be applied in the modeling mechanism of adaptive EUD system environments. Such an approach is projected to implicitly assist the end-users in the enhancement of their performance during the development task of Marketing-IS},

To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact.

METHODOLOGY:We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and usage log data.

CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution.},

Typically, a user query is rather complex and cannot be well described using a single concept. However, it is less effective to tackle such complex queries by simply aggregating the individual search results for the constituent concepts. In this paper, we propose to introduce the learning to rank techniques to concept-based image search for complex queries. With freely available social tagged images, we first build concept detectors by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous visual features. Then, to formulate the image relevance, we explicitly model the individual weight of each constituent concept in a complex query. The dependence among constituent concepts, as well as the relatedness between query and non-query concepts, are also considered through modeling the pairwise concept correlations in a factorization way. Finally, we train our model to directly optimize the image ranking performance for complex queries under a pairwise learning to rank framework. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets well verified the promise of our approach.},

With major partners like Google, the BBC, and national governments backing the W3C standard, the semantic web is poised to change the way we think about information discovery. Core themes of metadata, collaboration, and interoperability make linked data a natural philosophical match for libraries. Many pieces of the semantic puzzle already exist for libraries: RDF converters for common metadata schemas, linked LCSH and authority data, digital library {\&} bibliographic ontology development, freely available triple stores, and open source tools to support development work. This paper provides an overview of the semantic web vision, outlines core concepts like RDF {\&} OWL in an accessible way, introduces some of the major linked data players, and discusses the ways in which libraries are beginning to create structured data and applications in this new space.

This model analyzes the process and activities people engage in when searching for, selecting, purchasing, using, evaluating and disposing of products and services so as to satisfy their needs and desires. We have developed a scalable prototype system based on this consumer behaviour model using Hadoop Framework which selects and displays relevant advertisements in the web site to the satisfaction of the consumers.},

However, when applied to universities, analytical systems have been less successful. In order to deal with this issue, several approaches have appeared recently, most of them under the umbrella of learning analytics. These new systems tend to be very focused and not sponsored by university leaders, as contraposition to BI systems. This leads to some problems when generalizing or adapting the created systems to institutional level. Therefore, there are two analytical approaches in universities: one focused on management and with institutional support and the other focused on the university activities without institutional support. We believe that both approaches should be joined to create institutional and transversal analytical information systems for universities. The purpose of this work is to put forward this idea, demonstrating that developing analytical information systems in universities is a grand challenge for information systems research.},

This risk arises because we can never be completely certain about the trustworthiness of entities that mediate our on-line interactions. To minimise this risk, users must be given the chance to assess trust on the network, and be given an opportunity to pick an option with the least level of perceived risk. In this paper, we explain why traditional network security mechanisms are incomplete in their function to manage trust, and provide a general model based on recommendations.},

abstract = {Abstract High capital value goods that are purchased only after long and careful consideration, such as a car, truck, appliance (called high-involvement products) are increasingly being purchased online. For these products accurate recommendations are very important. Collaborative filtering (CF) is a commonly used approach for recommending products based on known preferences of similar users. Two challenges that limit the performance of CF in high-involvement products are the ratings' sparsity and dynamics. We use online reviews as an auxiliary information source and design a hybrid CF method to address the sparsity problem. Additionally, we consider the dynamics that may exist in online ratings and reviews. Specifically, we first investigate empirically the evolution of the ratings and reviews over time and sequence. The results show that there are both temporal and sequential dynamics in online ratings, and only temporal dynamics in online reviews. Next, considering these dynamics, we develop techniques to predict missing ratings based on online reviews and product similarities. The sparsity of the User{\textendash}Item rating matrix is alleviated by filling these predicted ratings. The experiment, based on real-world datasets, demonstrates the superior performance of our recommendation approach for high-involvement products.},

abstract = {The goal of machine learning is to program computers to use example data or past experience to solve a given problem. Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, recognize faces or spoken speech, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. <i>Introduction to Machine Learning</i> is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. It discusses many methods based in different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining, in order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The book can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. It will also be of interest to engineers in the field who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods.<br /> <br /> After an introduction that defines machine learning and gives examples of machine learning applications, the book covers supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, dimensionality reduction, clustering, nonparametric methods, decision trees, linear discrimination, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, combining multiple learners, and reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Abstract With the advent of the two-day weekend and improvements in the public transit system, people have begun to focus on leisure activities. When the YouBike public bicycle system was installed in the city of Taichung, Taiwan, it created a convenient transportation system network that was set up perfectly for a tremendous impact on the local tourism industry. This has happened in parallel with the development and proliferation of smartphones and wireless networks. The functions of mobile applications ({\textquotedblleft}apps{\textquotedblright}) have become more powerful over time, allowing people to access travel information and share their experiences almost instantaneously. Since a smartphone{\textquoteright}s positioning system can be used to provide more personalized information and services, the development trend is heading toward location-based services (LBSs) that can bring the app{\textquoteright}s functionality closer to the needs of the user. This study develops a personalized location-based mobile tourism application (PLMTA) for travel planning. The PLMTA combines hybrid filtering technology with the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to make more efficient customized tourism recommendations. It allows users to more effectively search through travel information and arrange their trip. This study also integrates the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the information system success model (ISSM) to present a research model that explores users{\textquoteright} intention to use the PLMTA. The questionnaire survey method is used to collect our data, and the hypotheses are tested via structural equation modeling (SEM). The results show that information quality, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness significantly affect the intention to use PLMTA, while information quality and perceived convenience are found to have an influence on perceived usefulness. Information quality, system quality, and perceived convenience are found to significantly affect perceived ease of use, which consequently affects the intention to use the system.},

abstract = {Currently in Brazil, a fundamental change is taking place in TV: the migration from analogue to digital TV system. This change has two main implications: an increase in transmission capacity for new channels with the same bandwidth and the ability to send applications with multiplexed audio-visual content. Brazilian government aims to exploit the transmission capacity for new channels offering programming created to distance learning and thereby promoting social inclusion in the vast majority of the population. This information overload demands mechanisms to help students to browse and select what education programs are best suited to their current level. Personalized recommendation systems emerge as a solution to this problem, providing the viewer with educational programs relevant to his profile. In this paper we present a personalized recommendation system, the Recommender consistent with the reference implementation of the Brazilian digital TV system. Finally, we present the results obtained after using the proposed system.},

abstract = {Abstract Advances in computing technology have been instrumental in creating an assortment of powerful information visualization techniques. However, the selection of a suitable and effective visualization technique for a specific dataset and a data mining task is not trivial. This work automatically selects an appropriate visualization technique based on the given metadata and the task that a user intends to perform. The appropriate visualization is predicted based on an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model which classifies the input data into one of the eight predefined classes. A purpose built dataset extracted from the existing knowledge in the discipline is utilized to train the neural network. The dataset covers eight visualization techniques, including: histogram, line chart, pie chart, scatter plot, parallel coordinates, map, treemap, and linked graph. Various architectures using different numbers of hidden units, hidden layers, and input and output data formats have been evaluated to find the optimal neural network architecture. The performance of neural networks is measured using: confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of the classification. Optimal neural network architecture is determined by convergence time and number of iterations. The results obtained from the best ANN architecture are compared with five other classifiers, k-nearest neighbor, na{\"\i}ve Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine. The proposed system outperforms four classifiers in terms of accuracy and all five classifiers based on execution time. The trained neural network is also tested on twenty real-world benchmark datasets, where the proposed approach also provides two alternate visualizations, in addition to the most suitable one, for a particular dataset. A qualitative comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches is also presented. The results show that the proposed technique assists in selecting an appropriate visualization technique for a given dataset with high accuracy.},

abstract = {Abstract Detecting topics from Twitter has been widely studied for understanding social events. There are two types of topics, i.e., global topics attracting widespread tweets with larger volume and local topics drawing attention of limited tweets of somewhere. However, most of existent works neglect the difference between them and suffer from the Long Tail Effect, resulting in the inability to detect the local one. In this paper, we distinguish global and local topics by associating each tweet with both of them simultaneously. We propose a probabilistic graphical model to extract global and local topics related to social events in a unified framework at the same time. Our model learns global topics using tweets scattered around all locations, while studies local topics merely utilizing tweets within the corresponding location. We collect two tweet datasets on Twitter from several cities in USA and evaluate our model over them. The experimental results show significant improvement of our model compared to baseline methods.},

The ability of social relations in alleviating the harmful effects of health risks is known as social support. Computing can be used to promote social support to enhance the care of non-communicable diseases. However, it is unclear how computing obtains such enhancement. This paper presents a systematic review, in the form of a mapping study, aiming to answer how computing enhances non-communicable diseases care by using social data and by promoting social support. It also looks for available computing models focused on social support promotion in non-communicable diseases care. The study was guided by a two-phase process review, resulting in 38 reviewed papers from journals, conferences, and chapters in the period from 2010 to 2016. In general, the reviewed papers focus on controlled trials, frameworks and systems, knowledge discovery, simulation models or social media usage analysis. Knowledge discovery was the predominant subject, followed by social media usage analysis, and frameworks and systems.},

Leveraging this information within learning environments bears beneficial opportunities that can i) bring the educational (what learners learn in educational settings) and social (what they perform within their social networks) worlds closer, and ii) support further recommendation and personalization services based on more 'real' data about learners. This information, however, is neither explicitly available nor formally represented on the social Web paradigm, an attribute of the social Web regarded as being a "walled garden ". In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages semantic Web technologies to locate and extract such data, originating from multiple resources on the social web, to support advanced learning services such as personalized peer recommendation.

However, due to restrictions of existing positioning technologies, mobile recommender systems are still not being applied to indoor shopping, which continues to be the main shopping mode. In this paper, we develop a mobile recommender system for stores under the circumstance of indoor shopping, based on the proposed novel indoor mobile positioning approach by using received signal patterns of mobile phones, which can overcome the disadvantages of existing positioning technologies. Especially, the mobile recommender system can implicitly capture users{\textquoteright} preferences by analyzing users{\textquoteright} positions, without requiring users{\textquoteright} explicit inputting, and take the contextual information into consideration when making recommendations. A comprehensive experimental evaluation shows the new proposed mobile recommender system achieves much better user satisfaction than the benchmark method, without losing obvious recommendation performances.},

Based on a survey related to how students find additional bibliographical resources for university courses, we concluded there is a strong need for recommended learning materials, for specialized online search and for personalized learning tools. As a result, we developed an educational collaborative filtering recommender agent, with an integrated learning style finder. The agent produces two types of recommendations: suggestions and shortcuts for learning materials and learning tools, helping the learner to better navigate through educational resources. Shortcuts are created taking into account only the user{\textquoteright}s profile, while suggestions are created using the choices made by the learners with similar learning styles. The learning style finder assigns to each user a profile model, taking into account an index of learning styles, as well as patterns discovered in the virtual behavior of the user. The current study presents the agent itself, as well as its integration to a virtual collaborative learning environment and its success and limitations, based on users{\textquoteright} feedback.},

abstract = {In this paper, using longitudinal data on route level monthly average weekday ridership in the entire Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) bus system from January 2002 through December 2010, we evaluate the ridership effects of the CTA real-time bus information system. This bus information system is called CTA Bus Tracker and was incrementally implemented on different CTA bus routes from August 2006 to May 2009. To take account of other factors that might affect bus ridership, we also include data on unemployment levels, gas prices, local weather conditions, transit service attributes, and socioeconomic characteristics during the study period. This combined longitudinal data source enables us to implement a quasi-experimental design with statistical controls to examine changes in monthly average weekday ridership, before and after the Bus Tracker system was implemented, on each bus route. Based on a linear mixed model, we found that the provision of Bus Tracker service does increase CTA bus ridership, although the average increase is modest. Further, the study findings suggest that there are temporal variations of the ridership effects among the routes, with the {\textquotedblleft}winning{\textquotedblright} routes more likely to have the technology implemented in the later phases of the overall {\textquotedblleft}roll-out{\textquotedblright} period. However, the results are less conclusive regarding geographical variations in the effects of Bus Tracker.},

abstract = {Abstract Social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, have grown rapidly in recent years. Friend recommendation systems, as an important emerging component of social media, may efficiently expand social media networks by proactively recommending new and potentially high-quality friends to users. Literature review has shown that prior research work on friend recommendation mainly focuses on the linking relation between users in social media but largely neglects the influence of users' attributes. In this study, we have systematically reviewed and evaluated the existing state-of-the-art friend recommendation algorithms. We introduce a new Friend Recommendation system using a User's Total Attributes Information (FRUTAI) based on the law of total probability. The proposed method can be easily extended according to the increasing number of a user's attributes with low computation cost. Furthermore, the FRUTAI is a universal friend recommendation method and can be applied in different types of social media because it does not distinguish the structure of the network. We have collected 7 million users' public information and their friend relationships from RenRen, commonly regarded as the Facebook of China. Using the real-world data from a dominant social media provider, we extensively evaluate the proposed method with other existing friend recommendation algorithms. Our experimental results have demonstrated the comparatively better performance of FRUTAI. In our empirical studies, we have observed that the performance of FRUTAI is related to the number of a user's friends. In particular, when a user has a small number of friends, the proposed FRUTAI algorithm performs better than other algorithms; when a user has a large number of friends, the overall performance of FRUTAI becomes less competitive but is still comparable to those of other providers, and its precision rate is quite outstanding. Our findings may provide some important practical implications to social media design and performance.},

Das NMC hat {\"u}ber die Jahre seiner Arbeit ein erprobtes Verfahren zur Erstellung der Berichte entwickelt. Den Kern bildet die Delphi-Methode. Unter der Leitung des NMC (Samantha Becker) sowie der Co-Principal-Investigators{\textquotedblleft} (Lambert Heller, TIB Hannover; Andreas Kirstein, ETH-Bibliothek Z{\"u}rich, Rudolf Mumenthaler, HTW Chur ; Franziska Regner, ETH-Bibliothek Z{\"u}rich) arbeiten rund 50 Expertinnen und Experten aus Bibliotheken weltweit an der Entwicklung der Library Edition zusammen. Unterst{\"u}tzt wird die mittels Desktop-Recherche, Befragung und Wahl von Trends durchgef{\"u}hrte Erkenntnisgewinnung durch ein Wiki, das Workflows und Abstimmungen integriert. Welche Erkenntnisse entstehen, wenn eine zuf{\"a}llig zusammengesetzte Gruppe von im Bibliotheksbereich t{\"a}tigen Personen sich 120 Minuten konzentriert dem Thema Trendanalyse und Zukunftsszenarien zuwendet? Dies soll im Hands-on-Lab erprobt werden. {\"U}ber die sich vom NMC Report unterscheidende personelle Zusammensetzung der Gruppe hinaus soll im Hands-on Lab zudem in pers{\"o}nlichem Austausch gearbeitet werden. Statt der Delphi-Methode werden mittels des Desing Thinking Toolkits Szenarien entwickelt. Nebst diesen Aspekten ist nat{\"u}rlich auch der Zeitrahmen ein ganz anderer: W{\"a}hrend der NMC Horizon Report {\"u}ber drei Monate entsteht, stehen der Workshop-Gruppe genau 120 Minuten zur Verf{\"u}gung. Das ambitionierte Ziel ist es, ausgew{\"a}hlte Schl{\"u}sseltrends des Reports im Kontext des deutschsprachigen Bibliothekswesens zu vertiefen und weiter zu entwickeln, sodass die langfristigen Auswirkungen auf die Bibliotheken deutlicher hervortreten. Die Erkenntnisgewinnung, Diskussion und Ausarbeitung von Ergebnissen wird in Gruppen durchgef{\"u}hrt. Die Resultate der Gruppenarbeiten werden in der letzten halben Stunde gegenseitig vorgestellt und zu einer Gesamtsicht konsolidiert.},

abstract = {Abstract Argumentation mining is a recent challenge concerning the automatic extraction of arguments from unstructured textual corpora. Argumentation mining technologies are rapidly evolving and show a clear potential for application in diverse areas such as recommender systems, policy-making and the legal domain. There is a long-recognised need for tools that enable users to browse, visualise, search, and manipulate arguments and argument structures. There is, however, a lack of widely accessible tools. In this article we describe the technology behind MARGOT, the first online argumentation mining system designed to reach out to the wider community of potential users of these new technologies. We evaluate its performance and discuss its possible application in the analysis of content from various domains.},

abstract = {Abstract In the social web, people use social systems for sharing content and opinions, for communicating with friends, for tagging, etc. People usually have different accounts and different profiles on all of these systems. Several tools for user data aggregation and people search have been developed and protocols and standards for data portability have been defined. This paper presents an approach and an algorithm, named Cross-System User Data Discovery (CS-UDD), to retrieve and aggregate user data distributed on social websites. It is designed to crawl websites, retrieve profiles that may belong to the searched user, correlate them, aggregate the discovered data and return them to the searcher which may, for example, be an adaptive system. The user attributes retrieved, namely attribute{\textendash}value pairs, are associated with a certainty factor that expresses the confidence that they are true for the searched user. To test the algorithm, we ran it on two popular social networks, MySpace and Flickr. The evaluation has demonstrated the ability of the CS-UDD algorithm to discover unknown user attributes and has revealed high precision of the discovered attributes.},

abstract = {Abstract When clusters of electric vehicles charge simultaneously in urban areas, the capacity of the power network might not be adequate to accommodate the additional electricity demand. Recent studies suggest that real-time control strategies, like dynamic pricing of electricity, can spread the demand and help operators to avoid costly infrastructure investments. To assess the effectiveness of dynamic pricing, it is necessary to understand how electric vehicle drivers respond to uncertain future prices when they charge their vehicle away from home. Even when data is available from electric vehicle trials, the lack of variability in electricity prices renders them insufficient for this analysis. We resolve this problem by designing a survey where we observe the stated preferences of the respondents for hypothetical charging services. A novel feature of this survey is its interface, which resembles an online or smartphone application for parking-and-charging reservations. The time-of-booking choices are evaluated within a risky-choice modelling framework, where expected utility and non-expected utility specifications are compared to understand how people perceive price probabilities. In the progress, we bring together theoretical frameworks of forward-looking behaviour in contexts where individuals were subject to equivalent price uncertainties. The results suggest that (a) the majority of the electric vehicle drivers are risk averse by choosing a certain price to an uncertain one and (b) there is a non-linearity in their choices, with a disproportional influence by the upper end of the price distribution. This approach gives new perspectives in the way people plan their travel activities in advance and highlights the impact of uncertainty when managing limited resources in dense urban centres. Similar surveys and analyses could provide valuable insights in a wide range of innovative mobility applications, including car-sharing, ride-sharing and on-demand services.},

abstract = {Abstract The ubiquitous existence of personal mobile devices and the emergence of online social media have attracted an increasing number of users. This increase is due to the active presence of social media in these mobile devices. The convergence of social media and mobile communication networks generates a considerable amount of trending media contents (e.g., texts, audio, videos, and images) on the Internet while exchanging or sharing contents. However, while exchanging messages or trending contents through social networks, there is a serious concern to identify whether the contents or the images are real or belong to the claimed context using associated descriptive tags. In this paper, we propose a collaborative analysis model to identify if any trending image is altered or modified, and whether the content used to describe it is actually accurate. It is a challenge to provide the desired trending media content in a short time from the vast amount of trending images on the social networks. Online social network environment is heterogeneous in nature, which demands computational Intelligent (CI) techniques to deliver the required media content in an acceptable time to the users. To this end, a collaborative search algorithm is used to utilize the descriptive tags, and user interaction history. The collaboration of tags powers the investigation of a trending images. Accordingly, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed model by performing experiments on the online collected data set using the proposed collaborative analysis model.},

As we all known, sometimes we purchase goods or watch a movie do not really mean we like or we would purchase them again. Thus, it is necessary to take the relationship of nodes into account, which we use linkage-weight to indicate. However, most of prior work only consider the existence of linkages, ignoring the remarkable meaning of linkage between nodes. To evaluate our algorithm, we compare both the original link prediction local path index and simplified linkage-weight index (-1,0,1) to our index and our results achieve significantly better performance.},

The domain ontology is used to represent the learning materials. In this context, the ontology is composed by a hierarchy of concepts and sub-concepts. Whereas, the learner{\textquoteright}s ontology model represents a subset of the domain ontology, and the cluster-based recommendations are added as additional semantic recommendations to the model. Combining the content-based with the rule-based provides the user with hybrid recommendations. All of them influenced the re-ranking of the retrieved documents with different weights. Our proposed approach has been implemented on the HyperManyMedia1 platform.},

Based on the search results, the literature was synthesized, segregated into four major domains according to the purpose, nature and usage of the information technology/systems. The authors believe that this segregation within the information technology {\&}amp; systems continuous usage literature provides greater scalability, flexibility and space for future research. Moreover, this proposed segregation allows for future research to include more {\textquoteleft}systems{\textquoteright} in each category depending on the usage, relevance and nature of the {\textquoteleft}systems{\textquoteright} that will evolve over the period of time. Scalability will provide more insights and ideas that will help future research investigate and propose domain-specific conceptual or business models that will help facilitate an understanding of information technology/systems continuous usage according to the nature of the {\textquoteleft}system.{\textquoteright} Conclusions and recommendations are drawn and priorities are proposed for continuing research.},

Traditional studies on prior knowledge generation during reading activities have focused on extracting sentences from reading materials that are manually generated by website administrators and educators. This is time-consuming and strenuous, and hence personalized prior knowledge recommendation is difficult to perform. To cope with this problem, we combine the concept of prior knowledge with social tagging methods to assist the reading comprehension of students studying English. We incorporate tags into a tag based learning approach, which then identifies suitable supplementary materials for quickly constructing a student's prior knowledge reservoir. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach benefits the students by embedding the additional information in social knowledge, and hence significantly improve their on-line reading efficiency.},

abstract = {Abstract Embodied virtual agents have been increasingly implemented in e-commerce websites to provide a more natural, social, and engaging way to deliver product information to online shoppers. The media equation theory posits that users{\textquoteright} responses to computer agents adhere to human-to-human social rules; hence, effective designs of embodied virtual agents should be based upon social psychology rules. One such rule is the notion of specialisation. While the concept of media specialisation in terms of TVs, computers, websites, web agents, smartphones, and voice assistants have been examined; no studies have yet to explore the effects of specialists and generalist embodied virtual agents in a multi-product category online store. To bridge this research gap, an experiment was conducted in which university undergraduates (n = 132) were randomly divided to interact with either a multi-product category website that incorporated specialist virtual agents or a multi-product category website that deployed a generalist virtual agent. Consistent with the hypotheses of this study, it was shown that the use of specialist virtual agents (as compared to a generalist virtual agent) enhanced perceptions of agent expertise, information credibility, website trust (ability, benevolence, integrity), and purchase intention. Meditation analyses revealed that the effects of agent specialisation on purchase intention were mediated by perceived virtual agent expertise, perceived information credibility, and website trust (ability, benevolence, integrity). Finally, the effects of agent specialisation were shown to be more evident for females than for males. Theoretical and practical implications related to virtual agent specialisation in the context of multi-product category online stores are discussed in this paper.},

In common with some recent mail systems, Tapestry uses filtering to cope with large volumes of incoming documents. Where Tapestry differs from these systems is in its philosophy that humans provide the most reliable evaluation of documents, and so it uses collaborative filtering, which it implements by having users annotate documents, and then allowing filtering using those annotations. Because annotations are not known at the time that documents arrive, Tapestry filters must not only test incoming documents, but must also run repeatedly over the entire database of documents. This paper is a report on the Tapestry design and the status of its implementation."},

Recently, there have been approaches to drive the recommendations by the information stored in electronic health records, for which the traditional strategies applied in e-commerce, e-learning, entertainment and other areas have several pitfalls. We address those problems by introducing a filtering strategy centered on the semantic properties that characterize the items and the users. Preliminary experiments are reported that prove the advantages of this strategy, especially in what concerns the treatment given to users with unique preferences and needs.},

In particular, we provide an educational-oriented approach for building personalised e-learning environments that focuses on putting the learners' needs in the centre of the development process. Our approach proposes user centred design methodologies involving interdisciplinary teams of software developers and domain experts. It is illustrated in an adaptive e-learning system, where a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) was taken by nearly 400 learners. In particular, we report where user centred design methods can be applied along the e-learning life cycle to designing and evaluating personalisation support through recommendations in learning management systems.},

abstract = {AbstractBackground Given the significant increase in the use of the internet as an educational tool for diabetes, very little research has been published on the usability of healthcare websites, even though it is a determining factor for user satisfaction. Objective The aim of this study is to evaluate and critique the interfaces of existing diabetes websites for usability concerns and provide design solutions for improvement. Emphasis is placed on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus since it is the most common and life threatening form of diabetes. Method A usability test was performed on the interfaces of three existing diabetes websites, American Diabetes Association (www.diabetes.org), WebMD (www.webmd.com) and the National Diabetes Education Program (ndep.nih.gov). The goal was to collect qualitative and quantitative data to determine: (1) if participants are able to complete specified tasks successfully; (2) the length of time it takes participants to complete the specified tasks and; (3) participants{\textquoteright} satisfaction with the three websites. Twenty adults, 18 years of age and older participated in the study. Results The results from the MANOVA test revealed a significant difference between the three websites for number of clicks, number of errors and completion time when analyzed simultaneously. The ANOVA tests revealed a significant difference for all three variables. The Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test shows a significant difference for completion time between American Diabetes Association and WebMD. A significant difference was found for the number of clicks for the National Diabetes Education Program compared to the American Diabetes Association and WebMD. However, no significant difference was found for the number of clicks between American Diabetes Association and WebMD. Lastly, a significant difference was found between each interface for number of errors. Discussion Although, the American Diabetes Association web-interface was most favorable, there were many positive design elements for each interface. On the other hand, the significant amount of information overload experienced for each website left participants feeling perplexed. Thus, innovative solutions are needed to reduce information overload and ensure users are engaged and empowered to make informed decisions about their healthcare.},

We begin by discussing the advantages that use of Semantic Web technology afford in the area of knowledge management tools. The way in which OntoShare supports WWW-based communities of practice is described. Usage of OntoShare semiaautomatically builds an RDF-annotated information resource for the community (and potentially for others also). Observing that in practice the meanings of and relationships between concepts evolve over time, OntoShare supports a degree of ontology evolution based on usage of the system - that is, based on the kinds of information users are sharing and the concepts (ontological classes) to which they assign this information. A case study involving OntoShare was carried out. The evaluation exercise for this case study and its results are described. We conclude by describing avenues of ongoing and future research.},

Recommender System is expanding as an influential research area and has its applications in various fields like e-commerce, business, entertainment, education, medical sciences and so on. The developed applications in education field are limited to recommend the articles, research papers, courses and books to students and research scholars. However, application of recommender system to recommend faculty of an education institution to the students, management and other members does not exist. So to further extend its usage in education domain, applications of recommender system to recommend faculty of education institution to the students, management and other members is proposed and evaluated in this work. The collaborative filtering (CF) is used to implement Faculty Recommender and comparison between the user-user CF and item-item CF results is done to find the optimal approach for this proposed Faculty Recommender system.},

As the speed of information growth exceeds Moore{\textquoteright}s Law at the beginning of this new century, excessive data is making great troubles to human beings. However, there are so much potential and highly useful values hidden in the huge volume of data. A new scientific paradigm is born as data-intensive scientific discovery (DISD), also known as Big Data problems. A large number of fields and sectors, ranging from economic and business activities to public administration, from national security to scientific researches in many areas, involve with Big Data problems. On the one hand, Big Data is extremely valuable to produce productivity in businesses and evolutionary breakthroughs in scientific disciplines, which give us a lot of opportunities to make great progresses in many fields. There is no doubt that the future competitions in business productivity and technologies will surely converge into the Big Data explorations. On the other hand, Big Data also arises with many challenges, such as difficulties in data capture, data storage, data analysis and data visualization. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a close-up view about Big Data, including Big Data applications, Big Data opportunities and challenges, as well as the state-of-the-art techniques and technologies we currently adopt to deal with the Big Data problems. We also discuss several underlying methodologies to handle the data deluge, for example, granular computing, cloud computing, bio-inspired computing, and quantum computing.},

The increasing availability of large amounts of spatio-temporal data brings us opportunities and challenges to automatically discover valuable knowledge. While context-aware properties quickly became the key of the success of these pervasive applications, information related to user preferences and social signals still lack of adequate capitalization. Local search in LBSs is a peculiar service where recent and current interests, the network of explicit and implicit social interactions between users can be combined for effectively performing fine-tuned and personalized recommendations of points of interest. In this article we present the various and peculiar aspects of local search in mobile scenarios. Then we explore the added value of personalization and the benefits of considering social signals, summarizing open challenges and emerging technologies.},

abstract = {AbstractObjective To test the efficacy of a weight loss mobile app based on recommender systems and developed by experts in health promotion and computer science to target social support and self-monitoring of diet, physical activity (PA), and weight (Social POD app), compared to a commercially available diet and PA tracking app (standard). Materials and methods Overweight adults [N = 51] were recruited and randomly assigned to either the experimental group [n = 26; theory-based podcasts (TBP) + Social POD app] or the comparison group (n = 25; TBP + standard app). The Social POD app issued notifications to encourage users to self-monitor and send theory-based messages to support users who had not self-monitored in the previous 48 h. Independent samples t-test were used to examine group differences in kilograms lost and change in BMI. Analysis of covariance was used to analyze secondary outcomes while controlling for baseline values. Results Participant attrition was 12% (n = 3 experimental and n = 3 comparison). Experimental group participants lost significantly more weight ({\textminus}5.3 kg, CI: {\textminus}7.5, {\textminus}3.0) than comparison group ({\textminus}2.23 kg, CI: {\textminus}3.6, {\textminus}1.0; d = 0.8, r = 0.4, p = 0.02) and had a greater reduction in BMI (p = 0.02). While there were significant differences in positive outcome expectations between groups (p = 0.04) other secondary outcomes (e.g., caloric intake and social support) were not significant. Discussion Use of the Social POD app resulted in significantly greater weight loss than use of a commercially available tracking app. This mobile health intervention has the potential to be widely disseminated to reduce the risk of chronic disease associated with overweight and obesity.},

abstract = {Abstract Online social networks (OSNs), such as Facebook and Twitter, have become an integral part of our daily lives. There are hundreds of OSNs, and each offers particular services and functionalities. Recent studies show that many OSN users create accounts on multiple OSNs, using the same or different personal information. Collecting all the available data on an individual from several OSNs to fuse into a single profile can provide valuable information. In this paper, we introduce novel machine learning based methods for solving entity resolution (ER), a problem for matching user profiles across multiple OSNs. By using extracted features and supervised learning techniques, we developed classifiers which can perform entity matching between two profiles for the following scenarios: (a) matching users across two OSNs; (b) searching for a user by similar name; and (c) de-anonymizing a user's identity. The constructed classifiers were tested using data collected from two popular OSNs, Facebook and Xing. We then evaluated the classifiers' performances using measures such as true and false positive rates, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC). The classification performance measured by AUC was quite remarkable, with an AUC of up to 0.982 and an accuracy of up to 95.9% in identifying user profiles across two OSNs.},

Recommender systems help these end users by selecting a small but relevant subset of items for each user based on her/his preferences. This paper investigates the influence of affective metadata (metadata that describe the user's emotions) on the performance of a content-based recommender (CBR) system for images. The underlying assumption is that affective parameters are more closely related to the user's experience than generic metadata (e.g. genre) and are thus more suitable for separating the relevant items from the non-relevant. We propose a novel affective modeling approach based on users' emotive responses. We performed a user-interaction session and compared the performance of the recommender system with affective versus generic metadata. The results of the statistical analysis showed that the proposed affective parameters yield a significant improvement in the performance of the recommender system.},

Two examples of use of data mining techniques, namely, association rules mining and fuzzy representations are presented, from a study conducted in Europe and another in Australia. Both of these studies examine student learning, behaviors, and experiences within computer-supported classroom activities. In the first study, the technique of association rules mining was used to understand better how learners with different cognitive types interacted with a simulation to solve a problem. Association rules mining was found to be a useful method for obtaining reliable data about learners' use of the simulation and their performance with it. The study illustrates how data mining can be used to advance educational software evaluation practices in the field of educational technology. In the second study, the technique of fuzzy representations was employed to inductively explore questionnaire data. The study provides a good example of how educational technologists can use data mining for guiding and monitoring school-based technology integration efforts. Based on the outcomes, the implications of the study are discussed in terms of the need to develop educational data mining tools that can display results, information, explanations, comments, and recommendations in meaningful ways to non-expert users in data mining. Lastly, issues related to data privacy are addressed.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe a new ontological content-based filtering method for ranking the relevance of items for readers of news items, and its evaluation. The method has been implemented in ePaper, a personalised electronic newspaper prototype system. The method utilises a hierarchical ontology of news; it considers common and related concepts appearing in a user's profile on the one hand, and in a news item's profile on the other hand, and measures the "hierarchical distances" between these concepts. On that basis it computes the similarity between item and user profiles and rank-orders the news items according to their relevance to each user.Design/methodology/approach - The paper evaluates the performance of the filtering method in an experimental setting. Each participant read news items obtained from an electronic newspaper and rated their relevance. Independently, the filtering method is applied to the same items and generated, for each participant, a list of news items ranked according to relevance.Findings - The results of the evaluations revealed that the filtering algorithm, which takes into consideration hierarchically related concepts, yielded significantly better results than a filtering method that takes only common concepts into consideration. The paper determined a best set of values (weights) of the hierarchical similarity parameters. It also found out that the quality of filtering improves as the number of items used for implicit updates of the profile increases, and that even with implicitly updated profiles, it is better to start with user-defined profiles.Originality/value - The proposed content-based filtering method can be used for filtering not only news items but items from any domain, and not only with a three-level hierarchical ontology but any-level ontology, in any language.},

Knowledge structures, ranging in formality from ontologies to folksonomies, support user activity by enabling users to categorize and retrieve information resources. In this paper we enhance the search and recommendation functionalities of Enterprise Social Software by extending their knowledge structures with the addition of underlying hidden topics which we discover using probabilistic topic models. We employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation in order to elicit hidden topics and use the latter to assess similarities in resource and tag recommendation as well as for the expansion of query results. As an application of our approach we have extended the search and recommendation facilities of an open source Enterprise Social Software system which we have deployed and evaluated in five knowledge-intensive small and medium enterprises.},

Once understood from the perspective of crowds and clouds, big data or big content becomes one of the main drivers for the change we are describing. Digital ecosystems are, in many ways, set up to deal with big data and make it work as an economic force for change. This chapter first attempts to define big data from its use. Big data is much older than current debates might suggest. Science data has been big for a long time and has also driven the innovation of new ecosystems that could make this big data work. Today, many big data challenges are still driven by the demands of extreme science, but also by other big data organisations in business and government. The chapter investigates mainly social media applications and some of the current limitations of applying big data analytics here, before concluding with some critical remarks regarding the Big Brother potential behind big data.},

abstract = {The single-agent multi-armed bandit problem can be solved by an agent that learns the values of each action using reinforcement learning. However, the multi-agent version of the problem, the iterated normal form game, presents a more complex challenge, since the rewards available to each agent depend on the strategies of the others. We consider the behavior of value-based learning agents in this situation, and show that such agents cannot generally play at a Nash equilibrium, although if smooth best responses are used, a Nash distribution can be reached. We introduce a particular value-based learning algorithm, which we call individual Q-learning, and use stochastic approximation to study the asymptotic behavior, showing that strategies will converge to Nash distribution almost surely in 2-player zero-sum games and 2-player partnership games. Player-dependent learning rates are then considered, and it is shown that this extension converges in some games for which many algorithms, including the basic algorithm initially considered, fail to converge.},

It is of vital importance to understand it through lens of academic and real world data for our students and job candidates. Such analytics and knowledge can help to improve the system towards making right academic and career choices for fresh individuals. Traditionally, very little data is used by individual to make decision and most of the time; he or she is at mercy of trend, family inclination, finance and inner motivation. However, chances of success or failures are absolute unknown to them at that time. In this paper, we discuss the potential of using personality data from social networking such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn and correlating it with academic and career data to improve prediction and classify good fit and bad students accordingly. We present framework to utilize huge data with relevant features of personality of individual to reveal the useful analytics and insights. This work is in conjunction with our main research using Stochastic Probability Distribution, Bayesian Networks and Excel data tools. We provide relevant study and conclude with future work with recommendation to produce more Good fit students in our school and colleges.},

abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have received wide publicity and many institutions have invested considerable effort in developing, promoting and delivering such courses. However, there are still many unresolved questions relating to MOOCs and their effectiveness. One of the major recurring issues raised in both academic literature and the popular press is the consistently high dropout rate of MOOC learners. Although many thousands of participants enrolled on these courses, the completion rate for most courses is below 13%. This paper investigates MOOC attrition from several different perspectives. Firstly, we review existing literature relating to MOOC dropout rates, bringing together existing findings on completion rates and analyses of specific courses which identify factors that correlate to likelihood of dropout. We provide a meta-analysis of the basic figures on overall dropout rates previously collected to identify relationships between course factors and dropout rates. In addition, the literature is reviewed from a qualitative perspective drawing together perspectives on reasons for dropout and methods suggested for resolving or reducing the dropout rate. Secondly, using themes emerging from the initial investigation, we provide a preliminary analysis of data gathered from a Computing MOOC run by the University of Warwick, UK and presented using a Moodle platform. Different aspects of students{\textquoteright} demographic data are examined to see if relationships to persistence exist. An important feature of this course is that it has been run in two different parallel modes ({\textquotedblleft}traditional{\textquotedblright} MOOC mode with peer support, and {\textquotedblleft}supported{\textquotedblright} mode with real time, tutored programming labs). This allows direct comparison between the dropout figures for the two different modes. Qualitative information from student evaluations is also considered. Finally, we discuss our findings relating MOOC dropout rates, considering what factors are within the control of a MOOC provider and suggesting the most promising avenues for improvement. Our results indicate that many participants who may be classed as dropouts (for example, because they do not complete the necessary components to gain a certificate) are still participating in the course in their own preferred way (either at a slower pace or with selective engagement). This suggests that the structure of {\textquotedblleft}a course{\textquotedblright} may not be helpful to all participants and supporting different patterns of engagement and presentation of material may be beneficial.},

However, the challenge of making sense of all this data remains an open problem. In this paper, we present and evaluate an Information Extraction pipeline aimed at the construction of a Music Knowledge Base. Our approach starts off by collecting thousands of stories about songs from the songfacts.com website. Then, we combine a state-of-the-art Entity Linking tool and a linguistically motivated rule-based algorithm to extract semantic relations between entity pairs. Next, relations with similar semantics are grouped into clusters by exploiting syntactic dependencies. These relations are ranked thanks to a novel confidence measure based on statistical and linguistic evidence. Evaluation is carried out intrinsically, by assessing each component of the pipeline, as well as in an extrinsic task, in which we evaluate the contribution of natural language explanations in music recommendation. We demonstrate that our method is able to discover novel facts with high precision, which are missing in current generic as well as music-specific knowledge repositories.},

abstract = {Abstract Product complexity leads to increased unpredictability of indices related to manufacturing performance estimation. This phenomenon is intensified in companies that produce engineered-to-order products, such as the knowledge and labour intensive mould-making industry. During the initial capturing of product specifications formalisation difficulties arise. Moreover, the estimation of delivery times for new moulding project is solely based on the engineers{\textquoteright} experience. A methodology, which has been developed into a software tool is proposed that exposes graphical interfaces for customers to submit new orders and establish a formalised communication with the engineering team. The collected data are stored in a knowledge repository and are processed by a case-based reasoning mechanism for the lead time estimation. A real-life pilot installation has been initiated to a mould making SME. Preliminary results depict a significant reduction in the number of iterations between customers and engineering department compared to the traditional approach followed by the company, and improved accuracy of lead time estimation.},

abstract = {Abstract Fuzzy clustering is considered as an important tool in pattern recognition and knowledge discovery from a database; thus has been being applied broadly to various practical problems. Recent advances in data organization and processing such as the cloud computing technology which are suitable for the management, privacy and storing big datasets have made a significant breakthrough to information sciences and to the enhancement of the efficiency of fuzzy clustering. Distributed fuzzy clustering is an efficient mining technique that adapts the traditional fuzzy clustering with a new storage behavior where parts of the dataset are stored in different sites instead of the centralized main site. Some distributed fuzzy clustering algorithms were presented including the most effective one {\textendash} the CDFCM of Zhou et al. (2013). Based upon the observation that the communication cost and the quality of results in CDFCM could be ameliorated through the integration of a distributed picture fuzzy clustering with the facilitator model, in this paper we will present a novel distributed picture fuzzy clustering method on picture fuzzy sets so-called DPFCM. Experimental results on various datasets show that the clustering quality of DPFCM is better than those of CDFCM and relevant algorithms.},

 Recommender systems for e-learning demand specific pedagogy-oriented and hybrid recommendation strategies. Current systems are often based on time-consuming, top down information provisioning combined with intensive data-mining collaborative filtering approaches. However, such systems do not seem appropriate for Learning Networks where distributed information can often not be identified beforehand. Providing sound way-finding support for lifelong learners in Learning Networks requires dedicated personalised recommender systems (PRS), that offer the learners customised advise on which learning actions or programs to study next. Such systems should also be practically feasible and be developed with minimized effort. Currently, such so called light-weight PRS systems are scarcely available. This study shows that simulation studies can support the analysis and optimisation of PRS requirements prior to starting the costly process of their development, and practical implementation (including testing and revision) during field experiments in real-life learning situations. This simulation study confirms that providing recommendations leads towards more effective, more satisfied, and faster goal achievement. Furthermore, this study reveals that a light-weight hybrid PRS-system based on ratings is a good alternative for an ontology-based system, in particular for low-level goal achievement. Finally, it is found that rating-based light-weight hybrid PRS-systems enable more effective, more satisfied, and faster goal attainment than peer-based light-weight hybrid PRS-systems (incorporating collaborative techniques without rating).

abstract = {Abstract Psychological self-help services on mobile devices play a vital role in supporting emergency rescuers who engage in highly stressful and self-devoting careers with frequent exposure to dangers and traumatic scenes right after disaster strikes. In this study, we propose and design a low-cost and widely deployable strategy for empowering emergency rescuers through an intelligent mobile psychological self-help tool. This tool will help reduce the gap between the limited number of qualified professional counsellors and the high demand for timely psychological support by rescuers. We start with a thorough investigation of user requirements, extant work, and relevant IS design theories to inform our system design choices, among which we identified that {\textquotedblleft}virtual advisor identity{\textquotedblright} (VAI) needs further research. We then empirically examined how VAI influences the empowerment effect of ERMS. Involving 120 emergency rescuers who have just finished rescue tasks, our experiment shows that VAI has important effects on a user{\textquoteright}s cognitive and emotional routes, which are significant empowering enablers that lead to positive empowerment outcomes. Interestingly, virtual peer advisor empowers users mostly through evoking emotional resonance from them, whereas virtual expert advisor is better at empowering users through cognitive channels. Important theoretical and practical implications of the findings are then discussed.},

However, there is a bottleneck that the amount of available viewing logs and user friendship networks are too limited to design effective recommendation algorithms. Thus, carrying out an intelligent program recommendation system is important for these sites. In this work, we propose a novel model which turns to the social networks and mine user preferences information expressed in microblogs for evaluating the similarity between online movies and TV episodes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first effort to bridge the gap between movie and TV watchers domain with social network activities. Moreover, it is the first approach that can solve the {\textquotedblleft}cold-start{\textquotedblright} problem in movie and TV recommendation system. Series of data mining approaches and social computing models have been adopted in this work. Similar programs found from the social network are further used to suggest programs in other media devices. This work can be easily applied in online media streaming sites in order that intelligent recommendations of programs can be made to the customers through mining microblogs.},

Our proposed knowledge-based recommendation system analyzes the combination of visual and textual information in CBR medical system. In this paper a case-based reasoner uses medical expressions in a textual analysis to create word association profiles. Case-based Learning Assistant System (DePicT CLASS) finds significant references and learning materials by utilizing profile of words associations according to the problem description. This research proposes a new adaptation mechanism based on substitution, abstraction, and compositional method for collaborative recommendation in medical vocational educational training. The DePicT CLASS adaptation mechanism has a combination of value comparison based on requested word association profiles and manual adaptation based on user collaborative recommendation. In the adaptation process of the system, attract rate and adapt rate are defined and utilized for evaluating the adaptation results. Therefore, recommendation is a combination of references and learning materials with highest valued keyword association strength from the most similar cases.},

abstract = {Abstract Value creation is a major sustainability factor for enterprises, in addition to profit maximization and revenue generation. Modern enterprises collect big data from various inbound and outbound data sources. The inbound data sources handle data generated from the results of business operations, such as manufacturing, supply chain management, marketing, and human resource management, among others. Outbound data sources handle customer-generated data which are acquired directly or indirectly from customers, market analysis, surveys, product reviews, and transactional histories. However, cloud service utilization costs increase because of big data analytics and value creation activities for enterprises and customers. This article presents a novel concept of big data reduction at the customer end in which early data reduction operations are performed to achieve multiple objectives, such as (a) lowering the service utilization cost, (b) enhancing the trust between customers and enterprises, (c) preserving privacy of customers, (d) enabling secure data sharing, and (e) delegating data sharing control to customers. We also propose a framework for early data reduction at customer end and present a business model for end-to-end data reduction in enterprise applications. The article further presents a business model canvas and maps the future application areas with its nine components. Finally, the article discusses the technology adoption challenges for value creation through big data reduction in enterprise applications.},

abstract = {Abstract Considering the ever-increasing speed at which new textual content is generated, an efficient and effective use of large text corpora requires automated natural language processing and text analysis tools. A subset of such tools, namely automated semantic annotation tools, are capable of interlinking syntactical forms of text with their underlying semantic concepts. The optimal performance of automated semantic annotation tools often depends on tuning the values of the tools{\textquoteright} adjustable parameters to the specificities of the annotation task, and particularly to the characteristics of the text to be annotated. Such characteristics include the text domain, terseness or verbosity level, text length, structure and style. Since the default configuration of annotation tools is not suitable for the large variety of input texts that different combinations of these attributes can produce, users often need to adjust the annotators{\textquoteright} tunable parameters in order to get the best results. However, the configuration of semantic annotators is presently a tedious and time consuming task as it is primarily based on a manual trial-and-error process. In this paper, we propose a Parameter Tuning Architecture (PTA) for automating the task of configuring parameter values of semantic annotation tools. We describe the core fitness functions of PTA that operate on the quality of the annotations produced, and offer a solution, based on a genetic algorithm, for searching the space of possible parameter values. Our experiments demonstrate that PTA enables effective configuration of parameter values of many semantic annotation tools.},

However, current e-commerce recommender systems overlook some implications of the great diversity of products and services available in the market, giving rise to form fake neighborhoods in collaborative filtering strategies. In this paper, we propose applying semantic reasoning techniques to solve this problem, thus improving, qualitatively and computationally, the recommendation process. View full abstract},

Leveraging this information within learning environments bears beneficial opportunities that can i) bring the educational (what learners learn in educational settings) and social (what they perform within their social networks) worlds closer, and ii) support further recommendation and personalization services based on more 'real' data about learners. This information, however, is neither explicitly available nor formally represented on the social Web paradigm, an attribute of the social Web regarded as being a "walled garden ". In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages semantic Web technologies to locate and extract such data, originating from multiple resources on the social web, to support advanced learning services such as personalized peer recommendation.},

abstract = {This is a study of a matchmaking system that adaptively adjusts the recommendation model reflecting the user{\textquoteright}s implicit preference as well as the explicit one. Many matchmaking systems require their users to assign the level of importance, referred to as weight, of a certain attribute such as age, job, and salary when they select dating partners. However, many users do not know the exact level of importance of each attribute and thus, feel burdened to assign weights. Also, even though users explicitly assign weights, they are often in contrast to the users{\textquoteright} actual behaviors in many cases. This paper suggests a new matchmaking system called Adaptive Match-Making System (AMMS) that automatically adjusts the weight of each attribute by analyzing the user{\textquoteright}s previous behaviors. AMMS provides recommendations for newly entered users on the basis of their explicit-weights assigned by users. However, as the user{\textquoteright}s behavioral records are accumulated, it begins to build the logistic regression model in order to find out the user{\textquoteright}s implicit weights and reflects them in proportion to the accuracy of the resulting model. The prototype of AMMS is implemented by using Java and the web editor. It is applied to the created artificial dataset based on the real survey results from major matchmaking companies in Korea.},

abstract = {This study examined the impact of collaborative filtering (the so-called recommender) on college students{\textquoteright} use of an online forum for English learning. The forum was created with an open-source software, Drupal, and its extended recommender module. This study was guided by three main questions: 1) Is there any difference in online behaviors between students who use a traditional forum and students who use a forum with a recommender?; 2) Is there any difference in learning motivation between students who use a traditional forum and students who use a forum with a recommender?; 3) Is there any difference in learning achievement between students who use a traditional forum and students who use a forum with a recommender?. This study was a one-way quasi-experimental design where the independent variable was the type of forum (two levels: traditional forum and forum with recommender). Students registering in four sessions of a college English course participated in the study and were randomly assigned into two groups. The total sample number was 144. The whole experiment lasted eight weeks. All students took a diagnostic test as a pre-test in Week One. From Week Two to Week Seven, students joined the class and wrote summaries, reflections and comments on the online forum. Students in different groups went on different forums. All students were asked to participate in a midterm exam in Week Four, and a final exam and online survey in Week Eight. Data collected in this study included pre-test scores, midterm exam scores (receptive and productive language test scores), final exam scores (receptive and productive language test scores), online survey (motivation and recommender perception), and Weblog data. The data were analyzed by using ANOVA procedure and Wilcoxon{\textendash}Mann{\textendash}Whitney U-test. The findings were as follows: 1) Students in the group with the forum recommender read online posts more frequently than the control group, and 2) students with the forum recommender outperformed their counterparts in their productive language test scores. However, there was no significant difference in learning motivation between the two groups. To enhance motivation for using the recommender, students offered their comments on how to revise the recommender, such as making the recommendation rating more personalized and explicit. This study is expected to provide empirical evidence to recommender research in education as well as broaden innovative insights into instructional recommender design.},

abstract = {Personalized learning occurs when e-learning systems make deliberate efforts to design educational experiences that fit the needs, goals, talents, and interests of their learners. Researchers had recently begun to investigate various techniques to help teachers improve e-learning systems. In this paper, we describe a recommendation module of a programming tutoring system - Protus, which can automatically adapt to the interests and knowledge levels of learners. This system recognizes different patterns of learning style and learners{\textquoteright} habits through testing the learning styles of learners and mining their server logs. Firstly, it processes the clusters based on different learning styles. Next, it analyzes the habits and the interests of the learners through mining the frequent sequences by the AprioriAll algorithm. Finally, this system completes personalized recommendation of the learning content according to the ratings of these frequent sequences, provided by the Protus system. Some experiments were carried out with two real groups of learners: the experimental and the control group. Learners of the control group learned in a normal way and did not receive any recommendation or guidance through the course, while the students of the experimental group were required to use the Protus system. The results show suitability of using this recommendation model, in order to suggest online learning activities to learners based on their learning style, knowledge and preferences.},

The idea is to disconnect content and its presentation, and make it possible for machines to understand data and, therefore, perform automatic tasks and services. This will not only enhance the possibilities of e-learning environments, but also bring new challenges where semantics and standardization play a main role. This is the case of learning elements; under this new approach, they must be reusable, interoperable, manageable, durable, and accessible. With the aim to accomplish this new conception, learning technology standards have being developed. Their utilization in the instructional design for e-learning environments should be considered. In this article, we point out the importance of learning technology standards explaining how we are defining learning objects and learning designs compliant with them.},

abstract = {Abstract Recommendation systems aim to recommend items or packages of items that are likely to be of interest to users. Previous work on recommendation systems has mostly focused on recommending points of interest (POI), to identify and suggest top-k items or packages that meet selection criteria and satisfy compatibility constraints on items in a package, where the (packages of) items are ranked by their usefulness to the users. As opposed to prior work, this paper investigates two issues beyond POI recommendation that are also important to recommendation systems. When there exist no sufficiently many POI that can be recommended, we propose (1) query relaxation recommendation to help users revise their selection criteria, or (2) adjustment recommendation to guide recommendation systems to modify their item collections, such that the users׳ requirements can be satisfied. We study two related problems, to decide (1) whether the query expressing the selection criteria can be relaxed to a limited extent, and (2) whether we can update a bounded number of items, such that the users can get desired recommendations. We establish the upper and lower bounds of these problems, all matching, for both combined and data complexity, when selection criteria and compatibility constraints are expressed in a variety of query languages, for both item recommendation and package recommendation. To understand where the complexity comes from, we also study the impact of variable sizes of packages, compatibility constraints and selection criteria on the analyses of these problems. Our results indicate that in most cases the complexity bounds of query relaxation and adjustment recommendation are comparable to their counterparts of the basic recommendation problem for testing whether a given set of (resp. packages of) items makes top-k items (resp. packages). In other words, extending recommendation systems with the query relaxation and adjustment recommendation functionalities typically does not incur extra overhead.},

It can be difficult for a user to share content with a set of real-life friends and associates; intended viewers of the content may have different CSP memberships than the content sharer. Web 2.0 users need usable mechanisms for sharing their content with each other in a controlled manner across boundaries of CSPs. In this position paper, we discuss the problem users face and propose a solution that builds upon the existing secret-link mechanism. Our proposed solution does not require users to setup another account on each CSP to view shared content and does not require any special software being installed. The mechanisms for content hosting and sharing are separated; CSPs do not need to change their existing access-control mechanisms.},

These data might be effectively used to promote regional historical and cultural tourism as well as to design special recommendation services for trip developers and individual tourists who are interested in regional history. We propose the technology for the creation of such a recommendation service on the basis of smart space approach. This approach employs multi-agent, event-oriented methods of service design with central information hub. Each of the agents exchanges information by means of subscribing and publication actions. An important feature of the smart space technology is the use of ontological formats to keep semantically described information and to infer new knowledge from it. This technology is scrutinized employing data on the history of Latgale.},

abstract = {Abstract Knowledge sharing has been proven to have affirmative effects on both the education and business sectors. Nevertheless, many professional virtual communities (PVC) have failed due to reasons, such as the low willingness of members to share knowledge with other members. In addition, it is not explicitly evident whether knowledge sharing in information security is able to reduce risk. To date, there have been relatively few empirical studies concerning the effects of knowledge sharing and its capability to reduce risk in information security communities. This paper proposes a model that is composed of two main parts. The first part is the Triandis theory, which is adapted to understand and foster the determinants of knowledge sharing behavior in PVCs. The second part explores the quantitative relationship between knowledge sharing and security risk reduction expectation. One hundred and forty-two members from the LinkedIn information security groups participated in this study. PLS analysis shows that perceived consequences, affect, and facilitating conditions have significant effects on knowledge sharing behavior. In contrast, social factors have shown insignificant effects on knowledge sharing behavior in information security communities. The results of the study demonstrate that there is a positive and strong relationship between knowledge sharing behavior and information security risk reduction expectation.},

The fuzzy probabilistic rough sets over two universes (FPRSMTU) can deal with a fuzzy relation and allow a tolerance inaccuracy in the construction of rough approximations in a fuzzy ISTU, which is a generalization of classic rough sets with fuzzy and probabilistic theories. As a necessary step for knowledge discovery based on rough sets, the fuzzy rough approximations of fuzzy ISTU need to be updated efficiently under dynamic data environment. Incremental technique is an efficient approach for dynamic information processing by making full use of previously obtained knowledge. In this paper, incremental approaches for updating approximations of fuzzy ISTU are proposed while some objects adding into or deleting from the two universes, and the corresponding incremental algorithms are designed. Experimental evaluations on real datasets as well as artificial datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed incremental updating method compared with the non-incremental method.},

This data provide a wealth of information about user behaviours and their potential is increasing, as it becomes ever-more common for images to be associated with location information in the form of geo-tags. Recently, there is an increasing tendency to adopt the information from these geo-tagged photos for learning to recommend tourist locations. In this paper, we aim to propose a system to recommend interesting tourist locations and interesting tourist travel sequences (i.e., sequence of tourist locations) from a collection of geo-tagged photos. Proposed system is capable of understanding context (i.e., time, date, and weather), as well as taking into account the collective wisdom of people, to make tourist recommendations. We illustrate our technique on a sample of public Flickr data set. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to generate better recommendations as compared to other state-of-the-art landmark based recommendation methods.},

Such optional engineering strategies consider that some systems, such as the Knowledge Support System (KSS) fulfill the needs of the knowledge user, by providing the services and management qualities they require. Some key features of the KSS have been analyzed to identify their main characteristics or system components according to the most recent trends. Lately, some solutions have been proposed to develop this type of knowledge system based on the approaches, Ontology Development and Ontology Learning (OL). In this paper, a novel model of an Ontology-Learning Knowledge Support System (OLeKSS) is proposed to keep these KSSs updated. The proposal applies concepts and methodologies of system modeling as well as a wide selection of OL processes from heterogeneous knowledge sources (ontologies, texts, and databases), in order to improve KSS{\textquoteright}s semantic product through a process of periodic knowledge updating. An application of a Systemic Methodology for OL (SMOL) in an academic Case Study illustrates the enhancement of the associated ontologies through process of population and enrichment.},

abstract = {An inverted, or flipped, classroom, where content delivery includes video lectures watched outside of the classroom, is a method that can free classroom time for learner-centered activities such as active and problem-based learning. This study compared the effectiveness of an inverted classroom to a traditional classroom in three areas: 1) content coverage; 2) student performance on traditional quizzes and exam problems; and 3) student observations and perception of the inverted classroom format. A control-treatment experiment comparing an inverted classroom to a traditional lecture-style format was used. The results show that: 1) the inverted classroom allowed the instructor to cover more material; 2) students participating in the inverted classroom performed as well or better on comparable quiz and exam questions and on open-ended design problems; and 3) while students initially struggled with the new format, they adapted quickly and found the inverted classroom format to be satisfactory and effective.},

abstract = {Abstract The goal of a group recommendation involves providing appropriate information for all members in a group. Most extant studies use aggregation methods to determine group preferences. An aggregation method is an approach that aggregates individual preferences of group members to recommend items to a group. Previous studies on aggregation methods only consider high averages, counts, and rankings to provide recommendations. However, the most important component of a group recommendation involves ensuring that majority of the members in a group are satisfied with the recommended results. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the deviation as an important element in aggregation methods. The present study involves proposing an upward leveling (UL) aggregation method that considers deviations for group recommendations. The UL recommends items with low deviations and high averages in conjunction with frequency of positive rating counts for group members. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the UL is validated to perform a comparative evaluation with existing aggregation methods by using the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) and diversity. The results indicate that the UL outperforms all the baselines and that the deviation plays an important role in the aggregation method.},

Social commerce in this regard represents a shift in consumers' thinking from inefficient individual-based consumption decisions to collaborative sharing and social shopping. In this study, we investigate social commerce from two different but interrelated angles (i.e., social shopping and social sharing). Built on the literature of social support, commitment-trust theory, and trust transfer theory, a research model was developed and empirically examined. The findings of this study demonstrated that both emotional and informational social support significantly affected consumers' trust and community commitment, which in turn exerted profound impacts on both social shopping and social sharing intention. Trust toward members also can be transferred into trust toward community, which further led to users' community commitment. Limitations and implications for both research and practice are discussed.},

An offer network is an architecture for a future economic system based on the matching of offers and demands without the intermediate of money. Intelligence requires a network of condition-action rules, where conditions represent challenges that elicit action in order to solve a problem or exploit an opportunity. In society, opportunities correspond to offers of goods or services, problems to demands. Tackling challenges means finding the best sequences of condition-action rules to connect all demands to the offers that can satisfy them. This can be achieved with the help of AI algorithms working on a public database of rules, demands and offers. Such a system would provide a universal medium for voluntary collaboration and economic exchange, efficiently coordinating the activities of all people on Earth. It would replace and subsume the patchwork of commercial and community-run sharing platforms presently running on the Internet. It can in principle resolve the traditional problems of the capitalist economy: poverty, inequality, externalities, poor sustainability and resilience, booms and busts, and the neglect of non-monetizable values.},

abstract = {Semantic Web is actually an extension of the current one in that it represents information more meaningfully for humans and computers alike. It enables the description of contents and services in machine-readable form, and enables annotating, discovering, publishing, advertising and composing services to be automated. It was developed based on Ontology, which is considered as the backbone of the Semantic Web. In other words, the current Web is transformed from being machine-readable to machine-understandable. In fact, Ontology is a key technique with which to annotate semantics and provide a common, comprehensible foundation for resources on the Semantic Web. Moreover, Ontology can provide a common vocabulary, a grammar for publishing data, and can supply a semantic description of data which can be used to preserve the Ontologies and keep them ready for inference. This paper provides basic concepts of web services and the Semantic Web, defines the structure and the main applications of ontology, and provides many relevant terms are explained in order to provide a basic understanding of ontologies.

abstract = {AbstractObjective Infobuttons are clinical decision tools embedded in the electronic health record that attempt to link clinical data with context sensitive knowledge resources. We systematically reviewed technical approaches that contribute to improved infobutton design, implementation and functionality. Methods We searched databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database from inception to March 1, 2016 for studies describing the use of infobuttons. We selected full review comparative studies, usability studies, and qualitative studies examining infobutton design and implementation. We abstracted usability measures such as user satisfaction, impact, and efficiency, as well as prediction accuracy of infobutton content retrieval algorithms and infobutton adoption/interoperability. Results We found 82 original research studies on infobuttons. Twelve studies met criteria for detailed abstraction. These studies investigated infobutton interoperability (1 study); tools to help tailor infobutton functionality (1 study); interventions to improve user experience (7 studies); and interventions to improve content retrieval by improving prediction of relevant knowledge resources and information needs (3 studies). In-depth interviews with implementers showed the Health Level Seven (HL7) Infobutton standard to be simple and easy to implement. A usability study demonstrated the feasibility of a tool to help medical librarians tailor infobutton functionality. User experience studies showed that access to resources with which users are familiar increased user satisfaction ratings; and that links to specific subsections of drug monographs increased information seeking efficiency. However, none of the user experience improvements led to increased usage uptake. Recommender systems based on machine learning algorithms outperformed hand-crafted rules in the prediction of relevant resources and clinicians{\textquoteright} information needs in a laboratory setting, but no studies were found using these techniques in clinical settings. Improved content indexing in one study led to improved content retrieval across three health care organizations. Conclusion Best practice technical approaches to ensure optimal infobutton functionality, design and implementation remain understudied. The HL7 Infobutton standard has supported wide adoption of infobutton functionality among clinical information systems and knowledge resources. Limited evidence supports infobutton enhancements such as links to specific subtopics, configuration of optimal resources for specific tasks and users, and improved indexing and content coverage. Further research is needed to investigate user experience improvements to increase infobutton use and effectiveness.},

abstract = {Abstract Collaborative filtering algorithms have become one of the most used approaches to provide personalized services for users to deal with abundance of information. The traditional algorithms just use the explicit user-item rating matrix to find similar users or items. To improve the accuracy of the ratings predicted by the collaborative filtering algorithms, social information is widely incorporated into the traditional ones. Different with the existed works focus on directly connected neighbors, we consider the community between the users. We design the algorithms in two aspects: one is that the members in the same community have similar tastes and preferences, the other is that the member's taste is affected by the other members. We simplify these two factors as community similarity and community affection. Community similarity is incorporated into modifying the model-based collaborative filtering algorithm as the social community-based regularization (SCR), which improves 6.2% in mean absolute error (MAE) and 6.1% in root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the existed social recommendation algorithm. Community affection is incorporated into modifying the neighborhood-based collaborative filtering algorithm as the neighbor-based collaborative filtering based on community detection (NCFC) which improve 14.8% in MAE and 8.1% in RMSE compared to user-based collaborative filtering (UCF).},

abstract = {Abstract Recommender systems (RSs) have proven to be valuable means for online users to cope with the information overload and have become one of the most powerful and popular tools in electronic commerce. RSs are software tools providing suggestions for items of interest to users; hence, they typically apply techniques and methodologies from Data Mining. The most frequently used technique is the classification as it matches the aims of RSs that basically classify items based on user{\textquoteright}s preferences. The main contribution of this paper is in the area of applying classification techniques to enhance the performance of RSs. In this paper, an Intelligent Adaptive Vertical Recommendation (IAVR) system will be introduced. IAVR recommends text documents related to a specific domain. Basically, the paper concentrates on the first phase of IAVR, which contains two modules; the first is a distiller, while the second is a multi-class classifier. The proposed distiller is employed as a binary classifier that elects documents related to the domain of interest. It is built upon a novel neuro-fuzzy system as well as a modified K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. On the other hand, the proposed multi-class classifier merges a new instance of Na{\"\i}ve Bayes (NB) classifier, that depends on a proposed learning technique called {\textquotedblleft}accumulative learning{\textquotedblright}, with association rules. Experimental results have proven the effectiveness of the proposed classifiers, which accordingly promote the overall system{\textquoteright}s recommendation accuracy.},

Our two experimental systems, Quickstep and Foxtrot, create user profiles from unobtrusively monitored behaviour and relevance feedback, representing the profiles in terms of a research paper topic ontology. A novel profile visualization approach is taken to acquire profile feedback. Research papers are classified using ontological classes and collaborative recommendation algorithms used to recommend papers seen by similar people on their current topics of interest. Two small-scale experiments, with 24 subjects over 3 months, and a large-scale experiment, with 260 subjects over an academic year, are conducted to evaluate different aspects of our approach. Ontological inference is shown to improve user profiling, external ontological knowledge used to successfully bootstrap a recommender system and profile visualization employed to improve profiling accuracy. The overall performance of our ontological recommender systems are also presented and favourably compared to other systems in the literature.},

While individuals, businesses, and governments are interested in evaluating the sentiments behind this content, there are no consistent conclusions on which sentiment classification technologies are best. Recent studies suggest that ensemble learning methods may have potential applicability in sentiment classification. In this study, we conduct a comparative assessment of the performance of three popular ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting, and Random Subspace) based on five base learners (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine) for sentiment classification. Moreover, ten public sentiment analysis datasets were investigated to verify the effectiveness of ensemble learning for sentiment analysis. Based on a total of 1200 comparative group experiments, empirical results reveal that ensemble methods substantially improve the performance of individual base learners for sentiment classification. Among the three ensemble methods, Random Subspace has the better comparative results, although it was seldom discussed in the literature. These results illustrate that ensemble learning methods can be used as a viable method for sentiment classification.},

We show that the IRPP is challenging from the computational point of view, present a mathematical programming formulation of the problem and discuss aspects of a solution method based on the column generation technique. We also show how some tools of probabilistic planning and agent-based modeling may be used to address important aspects of the problem.},

abstract = {Abstract The success of personal mobile communication technologies has led an emerging expansion of the telecommunication infrastructure but also to an explosion to mobile broadband data traffic as more and more people completely rely on their mobile devices, either for work or entertainment. The continuously interaction of their mobile devices with the mobile network infrastructure creates digital traces that can be easily logged by the network operators. These digital traces can be further used, apart from billing and resource management, for large-scale population monitoring using mobile traffic analysis. They could be integrated into intelligent systems that could help at detecting exceptional events such as riots, protests or even at disaster preventions with minimal costs and improve people safety and security, or even save lives. In this paper we study the use of fully anonymized and highly aggregate cellular network data, like Call Detail Records (CDRs) to analyze the telecommunication traffic and connect people, locations and events. The results show that by analyzing the CDR data exceptional spatio-temporal patterns of mobile data can be correlated to real-world events. For example, high user network activity was mapped to religious festivals, such as Ramadan, Le Grand Magal de Touba and the Tivaouane Maouloud festival. During the Ramadan period it was noticed that the communication pattern doubled during the night with a slow start during the morning and along the day. Furthermore, a peak increase in the number of voice calls and voice calls duration in the area of Kafoutine was mapped to the Casamance Conflict in the area which resulted in four deaths. Thus, these observations could be further used to develop an intelligent system that detects exceptional events in real-time from CDRs data monitoring. Such system could be used in intelligent transportation management, urban planning, emergency situations, network resource allocation and performance optimization, etc.},

However, previous studies related to the usage and estimation of tie strength either assume that this parameter is given or use a computational model of their own. The amount, variety and domain specific information required to apply these models makes the reproducing and reusing of existing results extremely costly or utterly impossible. In our research, we show empirically the relative importance of different social variables for the computation of the tie strength and propose a computational model independent of the Social Networks{\textquoteright} domain. Our experiments are based on a dataset obtained from a survey that involved more than 100 participants and comprised more than 500 social ties. The dataset is the first publicly available dataset to explicitly include tie strength measures.},

Therefore, rule acquisition is also an important issue, and the Web that implies inferential rules can be a major source of rule acquisition. We expect that it will be easier to acquire rules from a site by using similar rules of other sites in the same domain rather than starting from scratch. We proposed an automatic rule acquisition procedure using a rule ontology RuleToOnto, which represents information about the rule components and their structures. The rule acquisition procedure consists of the rule component identification step and the rule composition step. We developed A* algorithm for the rule composition and we performed experiments demonstrating that our ontology-based rule acquisition approach works in a real world application.},

In this paper we provide a comprehensive survey of the use of crowdsourcing in software engineering, seeking to cover all literature on this topic. We first review the definitions of crowdsourcing and derive our definition of Crowdsourcing Software Engineering together with its taxonomy. Then we summarise industrial crowdsourcing practice in software engineering and corresponding case studies. We further analyse the software engineering domains, tasks and applications for crowdsourcing and the platforms and stakeholders involved in realising Crowdsourced Software Engineering solutions. We conclude by exposing trends, open issues and opportunities for future research on Crowdsourced Software Engineering.},

Data collection took place through a structured questionnaire anonymously administered to 120 heavy users as well as text analysis of the ACAC scheme usage for the two most frequented boards by these heavy users during a one-week time period. The construct of students' perceptions of the ACAC scheme was ensured through factor analysis and reliability analysis. Three factors were extracted including Knowledge Integration, Knowledge Sharing, and Participation. The ACAC scheme usage for the non-academic {\textquotedblleft}gossip{\textquotedblright} board was much higher than that of the academic {\textquotedblleft}education{\textquotedblright} board. Questionnaire responses by Taiwanese university student heavy users accessing the PTT BBS mainly for non-academic purposes were found to be significantly different than those of the other four between subject groups including work, academic, and both academic and non-academic. Interpretations of these findings are given and their pedagogical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract Hereditary diseases and disorders constitute a public health problem. Many people in rural communities of developing countries of the world are particularly ignorant about the cause, modes of transmissions and the treatment plans for such diseases. In some cases, some people lack essential knowledge between common and rare hereditary diseases. It is therefore appropriate and essential to develop a mobile application that will act as an educative resource and a good knowledge base for common and rare hereditary diseases. The aim of this research is to develop AMAHD (Android Mobile Informatics Application for some Hereditary Diseases and Disorders). The objectives of this research are to create an android mobile application that will act as a reference point and provide useful information about various hereditary diseases to medical personnel and professionals; provide additional educational resource to biological and bioinformatics researchers in different higher institutions; and provide a pedagogical, diagnostic and complementary foundational learning tool for African research students in biosciences, bioinformatics, and all other categories of students that currently engage in multidisciplinary research in the aspect of hereditary diseases. Essential data was sourced from relevant literature. We developed AMAHD through an integration of programming languages in Java and XML (Extended Markup Language). SQLite was used to implement the database. We developed a Logical Disjunction Rule-based Algorithm (LDRA) for the AMAHD{\textquoteright}s diagnosis module. A comparative analysis between existing commercial hereditary mobile applications and AMAHD was conducted and the results presented. A world-wide online survey (spanning Africa, Asia, Europe, America and Australia) was conducted to sample the opinion of individuals across the globe on the classification of hereditary diseases as either rare or common, within their respective regions. In addition, an evaluation of AMAHD on the offline platform was conducted by administering paper questionnaires and asking users direct questions about how they respectively rate the performance of AMAHD based on certain evaluation criteria. Furthermore, a separate evaluation of AMAHD was conducted using online survey monkey. Finally, a comparative analysis between the results obtained from the online evaluation and offline evaluation of AMAHD was conducted and presented. The results of the surveymonkey online questionnaire revealed that: 58.49% of the participants agreed that AMAHD can be used to diagnose users ailments based on the hereditary disease symptoms they supplied to the mobile application; 13.21% disagreed, while 28.30% of the participants were indifferent. 71.7% of the participants agreed that AMAHD can act as a complementary resource for supplementary healthcare support; 5.66% disagreed, while 22.64% of the participants were indifferent. 88.46% of the participants agreed that AMAHD can be particularly supportive to developing countries where there is less awareness of the deadly effects on hereditary diseases; 1.92% disagreed, while 9.62% were indifferent. Finally, 86.79% of the participants agreed that AMAHD can be useful as an android health application, 13.21% disagreed.},

abstract = {Abstract Participation in discussions about the public interest can be enhanced by technology, but can also create an environment in which participants are overwhelmed by the quantity, quality, and diversity of information and arguments. Political participation is at a greater disadvantage than non-political activities in that participants from different parties already start out with established differences, which requires them to reach some form of common ground before progress can be made. Those seeking authentic deliberation are discouraged to participate when confronted with uncivil and inflammatory rhetoric. These issues are often exacerbated in online discussions, where lack of identity cues and low barriers to entry can lead to heightened incivility between participants, often labeled as {\textquotedblleft}flaming{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}trolling{\textquotedblright}. This paper explores the extent to which moderator systems, tools online discussion forums use to manage contributions, can reduce information overload and encourage civil conversations in virtual discussion spaces. Using the popular website Slashdot as an example of sound moderation in a public discourse setting, we found that users move toward consensus about which and how comments deserve to be moderated. Using these findings, we explore how transferable these systems are for participation in public matters specifically to the unique attributes of political discussion. Slashdot's political forum provides a comparison group that allowed us to find quantitative and qualitative differences in political posting, comments, and moderation. Our results show that large scale, civil participation is possible with a distributed moderation system that enables regularly lively debates to be conducted positively because the system provides tools for people to enforce norms of civility.},

abstract = {Abstract The evolution of social media has changed the landscape of online commerce for both organizations as well as customers. Introduction of social commerce websites has bought shift in consumers׳ buying decision, i.e. from individual to social shopping. This study aims to identify factors that influence an individual׳s decision to use social commerce websites in an Indian Context. A conceptual model was developed based on extensive literature review. Wherein total six factors that influence an individual׳s intention to use social commerce were identified and were divided into three broad categories: social factors (informational support and community commitment), trust (towards members and community) and website quality (ease of use and service quality). Research model was empirically examined using structural equation modeling. The findings of this study demonstrated positive relationship between all six factors and an individual׳s intention to use social commerce website. Additionally, study identified informational support as the most significant factor that influences an individual׳s intention to use social commerce website followed by trust towards members, service equality, trust towards community, ease of navigation, and community commitment.},

abstract = {Abstract The Wikipedia project has created one of the largest and best-known open knowledge communities. This community is a model for several similar efforts, both public and commercial, and even for the knowledge economy of the future e-society. For these reasons, issues of quality, social processes, and motivation within the Wikipedia knowledge community have attracted attention of researchers. Research has often used Social Network Analysis applied to networks created based on behavioral data available from the edit history of the Wikipedia. This paper asks the following question: are the popular assumptions about the social interpretations of networks created from the edit history valid? We verify commonly assumed interpretations of four types of networks created from discussions on Wikipedia talk pages, co-edits and reverts in Wikipedia articles, and edits of articles in various topics, by comparing these networks with results from a survey of editors of the Polish Wikipedia community. The results indicate that while the behavioral networks are strongly related to the declarations of respondents, only in one case of the network created from talk pages and interpreted as acquaintance we can observe a near equivalence. The article next describes improved definitions of behavioral indicators obtained through machine learning. The improved networks are much closer to their declarative counterparts. The main contribution of the article is a validated model of an acquaintance network among Wikipedia editors that can be derived from behavioral data and validly interpreted as acquaintance. Other contributions are improved versions of behavioral networks based on editing behavior and discussion history on the Wikipedia.},

In this paper, we examine the relationship between reader demographics, news attributes and tweet features with reader's credibility perception, and further examine the correlation among these factors. We found that reader's educational background and geo-location have significant correlation with their credibility perception, and furthermore the news attributes in tweets are also significantly correlated with reader's credibility perception. Despite differences in demographics, readers find features including the search topic keyword and the writing style of tweets most helpful in perceiving tweet credibility. While previous studies reported the use of specific features, our results showed that readers use combination of features to make decisions regarding tweet credibility. Comparing the credibility level predicted by an automatic prediction tool and that by reader's perception, we found that readers tend to be more trusting, possibly due to the limited explicit author information available on Twitter. Our study can help devise strategies to enhance the tweet credibility with readers and also help educate readers to be more cautious with information credibility on Twitter.},

abstract = {Learning object repositories play a key role in the vision of reusable learning contents and learning designs, serving as providers for learning-oriented artefacts. Nevertheless, current metadata creation practices result in artefact collections that lack machine-understandable metadata, which seriously hampers opportunities for reuse. Semantic Web ontologies can be used to improve the quality of learning object metadata records, but they are not enough by themselves. In order to respond to requests by returning adequate resources, the repository is required to be aware of the amount, type and quality of the metadata records it stores. The design of a learning object repository approach to "semantic lifecycle" is described and illustrated through the concrete architecture of the prototype of the SLOR (semantic learning object repository).

abstract = {In this article we report on a new digital interactive self-report method for the measurement of human affect. The AffectButton (Broekens and Brinkman, 2009. ACII 2009: IEEE) is a button that enables users to provide affective feedback in terms of values on the well-known three affective dimensions of pleasure (valence), arousal and dominance. The AffectButton is an interface component that functions and looks like a medium-sized button. The button presents one dynamically changing iconic facial expression that changes based on the coordinates of the user's pointer in the button. To give affective feedback the user selects the most appropriate expression by clicking the button, effectively enabling 1-click affective self-report on 3 affective dimensions. Here we analyze 5 previously published studies, and 3 novel large-scale studies (n=325, n=202, n=128). Our results show the reliability, validity, and usability of the button for acquiring three types of affective feedback in various domains. The tested domains are holiday preferences, real-time music annotation, emotion words, and textual situation descriptions (ANET). The types of affective feedback tested are preferences, affect attribution to the previously mentioned stimuli, and self-reported mood. All of the subjects tested were Dutch and aged between 15 and 56 years. We end this article with a discussion of the limitations of the AffectButton and of its relevance to areas including recommender systems, preference elicitation, social computing, online surveys, coaching and tutoring, experimental psychology and psychometrics, content annotation, and game consoles.},

abstract = {Abstract Explosive growth of e-learning in the recent years has caused difficulty of locating appropriate learning resources to learners in these environments. Recommender system is a promising technology in e-learning environments to present personalized offers and deliver suitable learning resources for supporting activity of users. Compared with resource recommendation in e-commerce systems, users in e-learning systems have topic preferences in e-learning systems. However, e-learning systems have their own characteristics and current e-commerce algorithms cannot effectively use these characteristics to address needs of recommendations in these environments. To address requirement of e-learning resource recommendation, this research uses attribute of resources and learners and the sequential patterns of the learner's accessed resource in recommendation process. Learner Tree (LT) is introduced to take into account explicit multi-attribute of resources, time-variant multi-preference of learner and learners' rating matrix simultaneously. Implicit attributes are introduced and discovered using matrix factorization. BIDE algorithm also is used to discover sequential patterns of resource accessing for improving the recommendation quality. Finally, the results recommendation of implicit and explicit attribute based collaborative filtering and BIDE are combined. The experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the previous algorithms on precision and recall measures and the learner's real learning preference can be satisfied accurately according to the real-time up dated contextual information.},

Graduate students (n~=~36) from three different online courses used their own mobile devices to track how much time they devoted to learn over a period of four months. Repeated measures of the Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire and Validity and Reliability of Time Management Questionnaire were taken along the course. Our findings reveal positive effects of tracking time on time management skills. Variations in the channel, content and timing of the mobile notifications to foster reflective practice are investigated, and time-logging patterns are described. These results not only provide evidence of the benefits of recording learning time, but also suggest relevant cues on how mobile notifications should be designed and prompted towards self-regulated learning of students in online courses.},

While human experts can identify spam, it is too expensive to manually evaluate a large number of pages. Instead, we propose techniques to semi-automatically separate reputable, good pages from spam. We first select a small set of seed pages to be evaluated by an expert. Once we manually identify the reputable seed pages, we use the link structure of the web to discover other pages that are likely to be good. In this paper we discuss possible ways to implement the seed selection and the discovery of good pages. We present results of experiments run on the World Wide Web indexed by AltaVista and evaluate the performance of our techniques. Our results show that we can effectively filter out spam from a significant fraction of the web, based on a good seed set of less than 200 sites.},

abstract = {Abstract Although web personalization has been examined by earlier literature reviews, an updated analysis of recent advances in the field is needed. The authors extend prior reviews of web personalization by discussing current areas of interest, research gaps and future directions. A literature review of the top 20 marketing and information systems journals published during the period of 2005{\textendash}2015 (May) shows active research output and the domination of IS publications. The examined research addresses three categories: user-specific aspects, implementation, and theoretical foundations. We then analyze a total of ten themes: six on topics concerning user-specific aspects and implementation that stem from the dataset and four on theoretical foundations that are predetermined and reflected upon using the dataset. Both theme-specific and general future research suggestions are discussed. Advanced contextualization is suggested as the primary area suitable for future research and building evidence for attaining business goals as a secondary topic. Finally, we propose a conceptualization of interpolated web personalization to be tested as a potential complement to current (extrapolated) approaches.},

abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) have attracted millions of active users and have become an integral part of today{\textquoteright}s web ecosystem. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, OSNs can be used to harvest private user data, distribute malware, control botnets, perform surveillance, spread misinformation, and even influence algorithmic trading. Usually, an adversary starts off by running an infiltration campaign using hijacked or adversary-owned OSN accounts, with an objective to connect with a large number of users in the targeted OSN. In this article, we evaluate how vulnerable OSNs are to a large-scale infiltration campaign run by socialbots: bots that control OSN accounts and mimic the actions of real users. We adopted the design of a traditional web-based botnet and built a prototype of a Socialbot Network (SbN): a group of coordinated programmable socialbots. We operated our prototype on Facebook for 8 weeks, and collected data about user behavior in response to a large-scale infiltration campaign. Our results show that (1) by exploiting known social behaviors of users, OSNs such as Facebook can be infiltrated with a success rate of up to 80%, (2) subject to user profile privacy settings, a successful infiltration can result in privacy breaches where even more private user data are exposed, (3) given the economics of today{\textquoteright}s underground markets, running a large-scale infiltration campaign might be profitable but is still not particularly attractive as a sustainable and independent business, (4) the security of socially-aware systems that use or integrate OSN platforms can be at risk, given the infiltration capability of an adversary in OSNs, and (5) defending against malicious socialbots raises a set of challenges that relate to web automation, online-offline identity binding, and usable security.},

They are often developed in parallel to the development of adaptive learning systems and thus, linked to the system{\textquoteright}s development. The adaptive learning systems literature reports numerous accounts of learner model development, but there are no reports on the methodological aspects of developing learner models and the relation between the development of the learner model component and the rest of the system. This paper presents the Participatory Learner Modelling Design methodology, which outlines the steps for learner model development and their relation to the development of the system. The methodology is illustrated with a case study of an adaptive educational system.},

abstract = {Abstract Incorporating contextual information in recommender systems is an effective approach to create more accurate and relevant recommendations. This review has been conducted to identify the contextual information and methods used for making recommendations in digital libraries as well as the way researchers understood and used relevant contextual information from the years 2001 to 2013 based on the Kitchenham systematic review methodology. The results indicated that contextual information incorporated into recommendations can be categorised into three contexts, namely users{\textquoteright} context, document{\textquoteright}s context, and environment context. In addition, the classical approaches such as collaborative filtering were employed more than the other approaches. Researchers have understood and exploited relevant contextual information through four ways, including citation of past studies, citation of past definitions, self-definitions, and field-query researches; however, citation of the past studies has been the most popular method. This review highlights the need for more investigations on the concept of context from user viewpoint in scholarly domains. It also discusses the way a context-aware recommender system can be effectively designed and implemented in digital libraries. Additionally, a few recommendations for future investigations on scholarly recommender systems are proposed.},

abstract = {Abstract Increasingly, retailers rely on interactive technologies to improve consumers' shopping experiences. On the one side, interactive kiosks and smart mirrors make use of dedicated devices and software to explain, configure, and recommend products. On the other side, computer programs {\textendash} so-called apps {\textendash} are installed on the consumer's own device for the same purpose. They can be used at home, or {\textendash} if installed on a mobile device {\textendash} in retail outlets or on the move. In all cases, augmented reality (AR) can support these purposes by placing virtual content (e.g. new furniture) in a real environment (the consumer's home). The overall perception and acceptance toward such interactive technologies are discussed in this paper. Users' perceptions and experiences are measured by applying a modified technology acceptance model (TAM). Four experiments, two with marker-based and two with markerless AR apps are presented to support the generalization of the results, the measurement models and the measurement approach. The results are satisfactory with regard to the robustness of the TAM model. However, the relative importance of hedonic (enjoyment, pleasure, fun) and utilitarian (information) aspects varies for different kinds of AR apps and has to be considered for improvement to occur. From a measurement point of view the acquiescence bias has to be dealt with when developing scale items.},

abstract = {Abstract Intrusion detection systems are important for detecting and reacting to the presence of unauthorised users of a network or system. They observe the actions of the system and its users and make decisions about the legitimacy of the activity and users. Much work on intrusion detection has focused on analysing the actions triggered by users, determining that atypical or disallowed actions may represent unauthorised use. It is also feasible to observe the users' own behaviour to see if they are acting in their'usual' way, reporting on any sufficiently-aberrant behaviour. Doing this requires a user profile, a feature found more often in marketing and education, but increasingly in security contexts. In this paper, we survey literature on intrusion detection and prevention systems from the viewpoint of exploiting the behaviour of the user in the context of their user profile to confirm or deny the legitimacy of their presence on the system (i.e. review of intrusion detection and prevention systems aimed at user profiling). User behaviour can be measured with both behavioural biometrics, such as keystroke speeds or mouse use, but also psychometrics which measure higher-order cognitive functions such as language and preferences.},

Ranging from e-Commerce to e-Government platforms, intelligent advisory systems, with user-centered design, can potentially overcome technical barriers that commonly exist on traditional websites. This study explores the impact of system{\textendash}user communication style similarities on the user's perception towards the virtual advisory service in the healthcare domain. Drawing on Similarity-Attraction Theory, we propose a research framework to investigate this relationship. Through a mixed-method approach, including preliminary surveys, experiments and follow-up interviews, this study shows that an intelligent advisory system's communication style, when aligned well with a user's communication style, can better engage the user and lead to more perceived transparency, enjoyment, informativeness and credibility during the interaction process. Overall, hedonic aspects of user perceptions are shown to be more critical for creating a feeling of social presence and reuse intentions than utilitarian ones. The implications of the study for research and practice are then discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract Under what conditions is serendipity most likely to occur? How much is serendipity influenced by what a person brings to the process, and how much by the environment in which the person is immersed? This study assessed (a) selected human characteristics that may influence the ability to experience serendipity (openness to experience, extraversion, and locus of control) and (b) selected perceptions of the environment in which people are immersed, including the creative environment, and selected characteristics (trigger rich, highlights triggers, enables connections, and leads to the unexpected). Finally, the study examined the relationships among these internal people-based and external, environmental, variables. Professionals, academics, and students engaged in thesis work (N = 289) responded to a web-based questionnaire that integrated six scales to measure these variables. Results were analysed using principal components analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, and multiple regression. We found some types of digital environments, (e.g., websites, databases, search engines, intranets, social media sites) may be more conducive to serendipity than others, while environments that manifest selected characteristics (trigger-rich, enable connections, and lead to the unexpected) are perceived more likely to foster serendipity than others. However, the perceived level of creativity expected in work environments was not associated with serendipity. In addition, while extraverted people may be more likely to experience serendipity in general, those who are open to experience or have an external locus of control are no more likely to experience serendipity than their counterparts. Notable from our findings was a failure in identifying individual differences that may influence a person{\textquoteright}s likelihood to experience serendipity, in contrast with our success in identifying how the environment in which the user is immersed may create a fertile environment for serendipity to occur.},

This comprehensive introduction to the field offers a computer science perspective, but also draws on ideas from game theory, economics, operations research, logic, philosophy and linguistics. It will serve as a reference for researchers in each of these fields, and be used as a text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses. Emphasizing foundations, the authors offer a broad and rigorous treatment of their subject, with thorough presentations of distributed problem solving, non-cooperative game theory, multiagent communication and learning, social choice, mechanism design, auctions, coalitional game theory, and logical theories of knowledge, belief, and other aspects of rational agency. For each topic, basic concepts are introduced, examples are given, proofs of key results are offered, and algorithmic considerations are examined. An appendix covers background material in probability theory, classical logic, Markov decision processes, and mathematical programming.},

A total of 206 surveyed data was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The result shows that perceived ease of use has a significant mediating effect on the relationship between tax service quality and online tax system, and tax service quality has a positive significant relationship with an online tax system. This study contributes to understanding the effective usage of the online tax system through self-employed taxpayers that leads to increase in tax compliance and revenue generation in Nigeria.},

abstract = {Abstract Recommender Systems (RSs) are software tools and techniques providing suggestions of relevant items to users. These systems have received increasing attention from both academy and industry since the 1990s, due to a variety of practical applications as well as complex problems to solve. Since then, the number of research papers published has increased significantly in many application domains (books, documents, images, movies, music, shopping, TV programs, and others). One of these domains has our attention in this paper due to the massive proliferation of televisions (TVs) with computational and network capabilities and due to the large amount of TV content and TV-related content available on the Web. With the evolution of TVs and RSs, the diversity of recommender systems for TV has increased substantially. In this direction, it is worth mentioning that we consider {\textquotedblleft}recommender systems for TV{\textquotedblright} as those that make recommendations of both TV-content and any content related to TV. Due to this diversity, more investigation is necessary because research on recommender systems for TV domain is still broader and less mature than in other research areas. Thus, this literature review (LR) seeks to classify, synthesize, and present studies according to different perspectives of RSs in the television domain. For that, we initially identified, from the scientific literature, 282 relevant papers published from 2003 to May, 2015. The papers were then categorized and discussed according to different research and development perspectives: recommended item types, approaches, algorithms, architectural models, output devices, user profiling and evaluation. The obtained results can be useful to reveal trends and opportunities for both researchers and practitioners in the area.},

abstract = {Computational trust representations are used by Trust Management (TM) systems to elicit information from users about the behavior of others. In most practically used TM systems, simple computational trust representations dominate, such as the three-valued discrete scale of {\textquotedblleft}negative{\textquotedblright}, {\textquotedblleft}neutral{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}positive{\textquotedblright} used in reputation systems of Internet auctions. This paper asks the question: what is the appropriate system for computational representation of human trust? In order to find an answer, we study a large trace of feedbacks and textual comments from a reputation system of an Internet auction. We discover that users systematically try to add information in the textual comments. Text-mining and NLP approaches reveal a taxonomy of non-positive feedbacks and an importance order on the categories of non-positive behavior. This importance order is further supported by survey data. Based on these observations, we propose and evaluate a complete, new computational trust representation system inspired by the work of Yager. This system is complemented by operators that can be used to produce rankings of most trusted agents. The operator used to create rankings selects Pareto-optimal agents with respect to the multiple criteria revealed by our trace analysis. The proposed system takes into account all criteria utilized by auction users to evaluate behavior, and the relative importance of these criteria. The proposed system is compared to the Detailed Seller Rating system introduced by eBay.},

abstract = {Abstract Online Social Network{\textquoteright}s (OSN) considered a spark that burst the Big Data era. The unfolding of every event, breaking new or trend flows in real time inside OSN triggering a surge of opinionated networked content. An unprecedented scale of social relationships also diffuses across this vastly interconnected system affecting public behaviors and knowledge construction. Extracting intelligence from such data has becoming a quickly widening multidisciplinary area that demands the synergy of scientific tools and expertise. Key analysis practices include social network analysis, sentiment analysis, trend analysis and collaborative recommendation. Though, both their recent advent and the fact that science is still in the frontiers of processing human-generated data, provokes the need for an update and comprehensible taxonomy of the related research. In response to this chaotic emerging science of social data, this paper provides a sophisticated classification of state-of the-art frameworks considering the diversity of practices, methods and techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt that illustrated the entire spectrum of social data networking analysis and their associated frameworks. The survey demonstrates challenges and future directions with a focus on text mining and the promising avenue of computational intelligence.},

Results show that using SNS is negatively correlated with marriage quality and happiness, and positively correlated with experiencing a troubled relationship and thinking about divorce. These correlations hold after a variety of economic, demographic, and psychological variables related to marriage well-being are taken into account. Further, the findings of this individual-level analysis are consistent with a state-level analysis of the most popular SNS to date: across the U.S., the diffusion of Facebook between 2008 and 2010 is positively correlated with increasing divorce rates during the same time period after controlling for all time-invariant factors of each state (fixed effects), and continues to hold when time-varying economic and socio-demographic factors that might affect divorce rates are also controlled. Possible explanations for these associations are discussed, particularly in the context of pro- and anti-social perspectives towards SNS and Facebook in particular.},

Since lots of search results could be returned by a search engine, and usually only a small portion of all the results contain valuable knowledge to the current search task, the user usually needs to read lots of documents and could only learn limited knowledge. This makes the learning phrase a low efficiency, time consuming and easy to fail process. In order to support the learning phrase of the exploratory search process, this paper proposes the concept exploration model which describes how a user reads search results and figures out interesting concepts. The model focuses on how does a user explore related concepts during the learning phrase, and factorizes the concept exploration process as a production of the probability that concepts form a specific relation structure, and the probability that a user is attracted by a concept. In an application example, the concept exploration model is used in a query recommendation task to support exploratory search. We demonstrate how to determine the two probabilistic factors and evaluate the model with a set of metrics. The experiment results show that the application example could help users explore domain concepts more effectively.},

abstract = {Abstract Simulation comprises an indispensable set of technological tools and methods for the successful implementation of digital manufacturing, since it allows for the experimentation and validation of product, process and system design and configuration. Especially in todays{\textquoteright} turbulent manufacturing environment, which is affected by megatrends such as globalisation and ever-increasing requirements for higher degree of product customisation and personalisation, the value of simulation is evident. This keynote paper investigates the major milestones in the evolution of simulation technologies and examines recent industrial and research applications and findings. Based on this review, the identification of gaps in current practices is presented, and future trends and challenges to be met on the field are outlined. The considered simulation methods and tools include CAx, Factory layout design, Material and Information flow design, Manufacturing Networks Design, Manufacturing Systems Planning and Control, Manufacturing Networks Planning and Control, Augmented and Virtual Reality in product and process design, planning and verification (ergonomics, robotics, etc.). The evolution, advances, current practices and future trends of these technologies, industrial applications and research results are discussed in the context of the contemporary manufacturing industry.},

abstract = {Abstract Consumers increasingly rely on online reviews to make purchase decisions. However, the process through which consumers are influenced by online reviews is not well understood. To fill the gap, we apply the social influence theory to theoretically explain and analyze this opinion change process. Specifically, we identify antecedents and consequences of two types of social influence from online user reviews: informational and value-expressive influence. From a survey conducted in a controlled laboratory environment, we found that perceived review quality positively impacts informational influence, while perceived review quality, consistency, and social presence jointly impact value-expressive influence. Interestingly, informational influence impacts both perceived decision quality and perceived usefulness of the website, while value-expressive influence only impacts perceived usefulness of the website. Surprisingly, consumer characteristics, including prior product expertise and self-monitoring, do not have significant effects on the formation of social influence online.},

However, the multitude of user related data types and recommender system algorithms makes it difficult for decision makers to choose the best combination for their specific business goals. Through a case study on job recommender systems in collaboration with the Flemish public employment services (VDAB), we evaluate what data types are most indicative of job seekers' vacancy interests, and how this impacts the appropriateness of the different types of recommender systems for job recommendation. We show that implicit feedback data covers a broader spectrum of job seekers' job interests than explicitly stated interests. Based on this insight we present a user-user collaborative filtering system solely based on this implicit feedback data. Our experiments show that this system outperforms the extensive knowledge-based recommender system currently employed by VDAB in both offline and expert evaluation. Furthermore, this study contributes to the existing recommender system literature by showing that, even in high risk recommendation contexts such as job recommendation, organizations should not only hang on to explicit feedback recommender systems but should embrace the value and abundance of available implicit feedback data.},

This study is focused on designing such a learning system by relating combinations of different learning styles to preferred types of multimedia materials. We explore a decision model aimed at proposing learning material of an appropriate multimedia type. This study includes 272 student participants. The resulting decision model shows that students prefer well-structured learning texts with color discrimination, and that the hemispheric learning style model is the most important criterion in deciding student preferences for different multimedia learning materials. To provide a more accurate and reliable model for recommending different multimedia types more learning style models must be combined. Kolb's classification and the VAK classification allow us to learn if students prefer an active role in the learning process, and what multimedia type they prefer.},

But, many students enter post-secondary education without a clear idea of their major and future career plans. Discovering students{\textquoteright} suitable occupations as early as possible can help them to choose an appropriate vocational learning direction and to build the skills and the abilities for the prospective occupation. For those reasons, students need an automatic counseling system. In order to do this, recommendation methods were employed; it aims to counsel suitable occupation for students, to discover their occupational interests and to guide them to improve their skills. We implemented a hybrid recommendation system called occupation recommendation (OCCREC) that integrates content-based and collaborative filtering methods. We involved three sets of information including student{\textquoteright}s profiles, vocational interests, and their behaviors. The student profile contains two types of data, namely, background and interest/hobby retrieved from Facebook. In the experiment, the students from four countries consisted of Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Thailand used the OCCREC. And, five occupations were shown to the students by using five similarity measures which are Euclidean, Intersection, Cosine, Jaccard, and Pearson. Finally, OCCREC allows students to rate the results accordingly based on user{\textquoteright}s satisfied scores and to share their experiences on Facebook.},

To this end, we mine a large corpus of documents from a Korean radio station{\textquoteright}s online bulletin board. Each document, written by the listener, is composed of a song request associated with a brief, personal story. We assume that such stories are closely related with the background of the song requests and thus, our system performs text analysis to recommend songs that were requested from other similar stories. We evaluate our system using conventional metrics along with a user evaluation test. Results show that there is close correlation between document similarity and song similarity, indicating the potential of using text as a source to recommending music.},

abstract = {Abstract The explosion of the learning materials in personal learning environments has caused difficulties to locate appropriate learning materials to learners. Personalized recommendations have been used to support the activities of learners in personal learning environments and this technology can deliver suitable learning materials to learners. In order to improve the quality of recommendations, this research considers the multidimensional attributes of material, rating of learners, and the order and sequential patterns of the learner{\textquoteright}s accessed material in a unified model. The proposed approach has two modules. In the sequential-based recommendation module, latent patterns of accessing materials are discovered and presented in two formats including the weighted association rules and the compact tree structure (called Pattern-tree). In the attribute-based module, after clustering the learners using latent patterns by K-means algorithm, the learner preference tree (LPT) is introduced to consider the multidimensional attributes of materials, rating of learners, and also order of the accessed materials. The mixed, weighted, and cascade hybrid methods are employed to generate the final combined recommendations. The experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous algorithms in terms of precision, recall, and intra-list similarity measure. The main contributions are improvement of the recommendations{\textquoteright} quality and alleviation of the sparsity problem by combining the contextual information, including order and sequential patterns of the accessed material, rating of learners, and the multidimensional attributes of materials.},

These data sets are used as benchmarks to develop new recommendation algorithms and to compare them to other algorithms in given settings. In this paper, we explore data sets that capture learner interactions with tools and resources and that can be used to evaluate and compare the performance of different recommendation algorithms for Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL). We present an experimental comparison of the accuracy of several collaborative filtering algorithms applied to these TEL data sets and elaborate on implicit relevance data, such as downloads and tags, that can be used to augment explicit relevance evidence and used to improve the performance of available recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {Abstract University-industry collaboration plays an important role in the success of R{\&}amp;D projects. One of the main challenges of university-industry collaboration is the identification of suitable partners. Due to the information asymmetry problem, it is difficult for companies to identify researchers from universities for collaboration on their R{\&}amp;D projects. Various expert recommendation systems (e.g., question responder recommenders and co-author recommenders) have been proposed, but they fail to characterize companies' needs in identifying suitable researchers. This paper proposes a context-aware researcher recommendation system to encourage university-industry collaboration on industrial R{\&}amp;D projects. The system has two modules: an offline preparation module and an online recommendation module. In the offline preparation module, candidate researchers are identified in advance to improve the efficiency of the context-aware recommendation. In the online recommendation module, contextual information (i.e., R{\&}amp;D projects) is captured from a social network platform, and then, candidate researchers are recommended based on a contextual trust analysis model, which combines the expertise relevance, quality, and trust relations of researchers to profile and evaluate candidate researchers for the R{\&}amp;D project collaboration. An offline experiment and a user study are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation system. The results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the baseline methods.},

abstract = {Web 2.0 users have many choices of content-hosting or application-service providers (CSPs). It can be difficult for a user to share content with a set of real-life friends and associates; intended viewers of the content may have different CSP memberships than the content sharer. Web 2.0 users need usable mechanisms for sharing their content with each other in a controlled manner across boundaries of CSPs. In this position paper, we discuss the problem users face and propose a solution that builds upon the existing secret-link mechanism. Our proposed solution does not require users to setup another account on each CSP to view shared content and does not require any special software being installed. The mechanisms for content hosting and sharing are separated; CSPs do not need to change their existing access-control mechanisms.},

Notwithstanding, we have as yet limited understanding of how organizations translate its potential into actual social and economic value. We conduct an in-depth systematic review of IS literature on the topic and identify six debates central to how organizations realize value from big data, at different levels of analysis. Based on this review, we identify two socio-technical features of big data that influence value realization: portability and interconnectivity. We argue that, in practice, organizations need to continuously realign work practices, organizational models, and stakeholder interests in order to reap the benefits from big data. We synthesize the findings by means of an integrated model.},

The aim of this study is to provide more insight within the context of Malaysia to understand the potential factors that importantly driving or inhibiting the decision of HIS adoption from non-adopters' perspective. This study mainly integrates the diffusion of innovation theory, technology-organization-environment framework, institutional theory along with human-organization-technology fit model that can be tailored in understanding of the HIS adoption by Malaysian public hospitals. In this regard, the initial model is designed by considering four main dimensions (Technology, Environment, Human, Organization) with seventeen variables based on reviewing of the existing extensive literature of information system in particular information technology adoption in line with prior HIS adoption studies. Accordingly, a Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (ANP), one of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques, model is developed to determine the most important factors among the four categories for the HIS adoption in the context of Malaysian public hospitals. These factors are identified and compared by 20 hospital experts and decision makers, who are fully familiar of HIS technology with also professional management and decision-making experience in hospitals. Then fuzzy ANP is applied to compute the weights of incorporated factors in the HIS adoption. The results reveal that hospitals with compatibility, complexity, mimetic pressure and vendor support are more likely to adopt HIS. Hence, the decision to adopt HIS is mainly determined by technological and environmental context. The study and its findings have resulted in theoretical contributions and research implications where the integrated theoretical model serves as a tool for healthcare industry to gain insight into the process of HIS adoption.},

We then propose a new multi-level user profiling model by integrating tags and ratings to achieve personalized search, which can reflect not only a user׳s likes but also a his or her dislikes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to integrate ratings and tags to model multi-level user profiles for personalized search.},

abstract = {To carry out effective teaching/learning processes, lecturers in a variety of educational institutions frequently need support. They therefore resort to advice from more experienced lecturers, to formal training processes such as specializations, master or doctoral degrees, or to self-training. High costs in time and money are invariably involved in the processes of formal training, while self-training and advice each bring their own specific risks (e.g. of following new trends that are not fully evaluated or the risk of applying techniques that are inappropriate in specific contexts).This paper presents a system that allows lecturers to define their best teaching strategies for use in the context of a specific class. The context is defined by: the specific characteristics of the subject being treated, the specific objectives that are expected to be achieved in the classroom session, the profile of the students on the course, the dominant characteristics of the teacher, and the classroom environment for each session, among others. The system presented is the Recommendation System of Pedagogical Patterns (RSPP). To construct the RSPP, an ontology representing the pedagogical patterns and their interaction with the fundamentals of the educational process was defined. A web information system was also defined to record information on courses, students, lecturers, etc.; an option based on a unified hybrid model (for content and collaborative filtering) of recommendations for pedagogical patterns was further added to the system. RSPP features a minable view, a tabular structure that summarizes and organizes the information registered in the rest of the system as well as facilitating the task of recommendation. The data recorded in the minable view is taken to a latent space, where noise is reduced and the essence of the information contained in the structure is distilled. This process makes use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), commonly used by information retrieval and recommendation systems. Satisfactory results both in the accuracy of the recommendations and in the use of the general application open the door for further research and expand the role of recommender systems in educational teacher support processes.},

Despite recent development of e-learning techniques which have broken the temporal and spatial barriers for learners, it is still very difficult to meet the requirement of efficient learning, as the key issues involve not only searching for learning resources but also identification of learning paths. People from diverse backgrounds, in most cases, also need to work as a group to acquire new knowledge or skills and complete certain tasks. As these tasks are normally assigned with time constraints, employment of e-learning systems may be the optimal approach. In this research, we study the issue of identifying a suitable learning path for a group of learners rather than a single learner in an e-learning environment. Particularly, a profile-based framework for the discovery of group learning paths is proposed by taking various learning-related factors into consideration. We also conduct experiments on real learners to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Web 2.0 represents an example of such a need-shifting technology, which has led to an embrace of new user interactivity services for many library websites, thus coined Library 2.0. This paradigm shift calls for new evaluation models to include the implementation of Web 2.0 technologies. The aim of this paper is to present such a model, and to evaluate the quality of Library 2.0 functionalities, measuring the quality of the 2.0 services offered through the websites based on user perception. We adopt fuzzy linguistic modeling to represent user perception, and apply aggregation operations to linguistic labels in order to evaluate the quality of the new services. Furthermore, our model subsumes the LibQUAL+ methodology, allowing for the identification of specific 2.0 functionalities in need of improvement and of those outstandingly satisfied by the system.},

Clustering is defined as an unsupervised learning where the objects are grouped on the basis of some similarity inherent among them. There are different methods for clustering the objects such as hierarchical, partitional, grid, density based and model based. The approaches used in these methods are discussed with their respective states of art and applicability. The measures of similarity as well as the evaluation criteria, which are the central components of clustering, are also presented in the paper. The applications of clustering in some fields like image segmentation, object and character recognition and data mining are highlighted.},

abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we propose a general framework for an intelligent recommender system that extends the concept of a knowledge-based recommender system. The intelligent recommender system exploits knowledge, learns, discovers new information, infers preferences and criticisms, among other things. For that, the framework of an intelligent recommender system is defined by the following components: knowledge representation paradigm, learning methods, and reasoning mechanisms. Additionally, it has five knowledge models about the different aspects that we can consider during a recommendation: users, items, domain, context and criticisms. The mix of the components exploits the knowledge, updates it and infers, among other things. In this work, we implement one intelligent recommender system based on this framework, using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs). Next, we test the performance of the intelligent recommender system with specialized criteria linked to the utilization of the knowledge in order to test the versatility and performance of the framework.},

abstract = {Abstract Digitization is a megatrend which affects all industries. But how does this affect learning on the job scenarios. The research project HANDELkompetent aims at digitization of work process integrated informal learning in retail with a methodological approach and a supporting digital learning environment. The method consists of an accompanied learning approach, where a dedicated person schedules the development of competences of staff in dialog. Learning content consists of small web-based trainings, i.e. learning-nuggets, which can be consumed in a few minutes. The learning environment is enhanced with a tablet pc app, which presents learning content to a learner. The app is enabled to deliver appropriate content to the learner by recognizing the learning situation by making use of device sensors, the actual competences of a learner and the target competences as registered in the learning environment. That means in detail that a learning position, e.g. cash point, warehouse or sales floor is tagged with iBeacons. Those iBeacons broadcast their identification via Bluetooth Low Energy. The tablet PCof a learner can identify these iBeacons and thus, the app determines the physical location of the learner. Besides the position the app can utilize microphone, camera or a brightness sensor for gathering context information, to derive the learning situation and to deliver appropriate content. We make use of the Digital Business Engineering Framework to structure our work. Digital Business Engineering is a methodological framework to deliver sustainable solutions for Digital Transformation. This paper shows our structural approach and first results of the development phase of the HANDELkompetent project.},

abstract = {In the web advertising domain, contextual advertising and sponsored search are two of the main advertising channels used to display related advertisements on web pages. A major challenge for contextual advertising is to match advertisements and web pages based on their semantics. When a web page and its semantically related advertisements contain many different words, the performance of the traditional methods can be very poor. In particular, there are few studies presented for Chinese contextual advertising that are based on semantics. To address these issues, we propose an ontology-based approach to Chinese semantic advertising. We utilize an ontology called the Taobao Ontology and populate it by automatically adding related phrases as instances. The ontology is used to match web pages and advertisements on a conceptual level. Based on the Taobao Ontology, the proposed method exploits seven distance functions to measure the similarities between concepts and web pages or advertisements. Then, the similarities between web pages and advertisements are calculated by considering the ontology-based similarities as well as term-based similarities. The empirical experiments indicate that our method is able to match Chinese web pages and advertisements with a relatively high accuracy. Among the seven distance functions, Cosine distance and Tanimoto distance show the best performance in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure. In addition, our method outperforms two contextual advertising methods, i.e., the impedance coupling method and the SVM-based method.},

According tothe "modelling view" of knowledge acquisition proposed by Clancey, themodeling activity must establish a correspondence between a knowledge baseand two separate subsystems: the agent's behavior (i.e. the problem-solvingexpertize) and its own environment (the problem domain). Current knowledgemodelling methodologies tend to focus on the former subsystem only, viewingdomain knowledge as strongly dependent on the particular task at hand: in fact,AI researchers seem to have been much more interested in the nature of reasoningrather than in the nature of the real world.

abstract = {Abstract Recommender systems are applications to retrieve useful information from large amount of online data to assist users in discovering interesting items/products in the system. Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, demographics-based filtering and hybrid approach are main approaches to realize recommendation systems. Most of the existing algorithms use a single approach to deal with recommendation problems. Besides, traditional recommendation approaches mainly deal with single dyadic relationships between users and items whereas data in real world are generally conceptualized in terms of objects and relations between them. Recommender systems based on Probabilistic Relational Model (PRM)1,2, a framework for learning probabilistic models from relational data, have tried to address this issue. However, existing PRM-based recommendation algorithms do not fit into our context where we are struggling with the contradictory situation of a real-world application that requires building a personalized recommender when no user profile exists. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to build a personalized PRM-based recommendation model with the help of users{\textquoteright} preferences on decision making criteria. Using our approach, content-based, collaborative filtering as well as hybrid models can be achieved from the same PRM. Applying the model on a real-world data from a cold system, we show that our model is actually capable of personalizing recommendations in coldstart situation.},

Afterwards, the paper will suggest the addition of a new model of humans that should serve as the base for the concept of law, the homo sustainabiliticus. Ensuing this discussion and consistent with the newly proposed definition of capital, a proposal for a new currency ({\textquotedblleft}new gold{\textquotedblright}) will be offered. This proposal suggests viewing usable, renewable energy, knowledge and data as the most important assets for the 21st century and is seen as the building block for the new sustainabilistic economy.},

We will also try to show that IL is changing in some of its aspects as a result of developments in the Research 2.0 domain, regardless of the fact that it is not widely adopted. The consequences resulting from the analyzed transformations in IL are of utmost importance for academic libraries, the content of their instructional activities and future information literacy conceptualizations.},

abstract = {Abstract A recommender system aims to provide users with personalized online product or service recommendations to handle the increasing online information overload problem and improve customer relationship management. Various recommender system techniques have been proposed since the mid-1990s, and many sorts of recommender system software have been developed recently for a variety of applications. Researchers and managers recognize that recommender systems offer great opportunities and challenges for business, government, education, and other domains, with more recent successful developments of recommender systems for real-world applications becoming apparent. It is thus vital that a high quality, instructive review of current trends should be conducted, not only of the theoretical research results but more importantly of the practical developments in recommender systems. This paper therefore reviews up-to-date application developments of recommender systems, clusters their applications into eight main categories: e-government, e-business, e-commerce/e-shopping, e-library, e-learning, e-tourism, e-resource services and e-group activities, and summarizes the related recommendation techniques used in each category. It systematically examines the reported recommender systems through four dimensions: recommendation methods (such as CF), recommender systems software (such as BizSeeker), real-world application domains (such as e-business) and application platforms (such as mobile-based platforms). Some significant new topics are identified and listed as new directions. By providing a state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers and practical professionals in their understanding of developments in recommender system applications.},

abstract = {Abstract There are plenty of expert and intelligent systems related to tourism, either for (1) selecting appropriate paths, (2) recommending routes or travel packages, (3) simulating certain implications in tourism, or (4) virtually immersing tourists. However, to the best of author{\textquoteright}s knowledge, none of these works provides a system that simulates how many tourist people sign up for each tourist route considering the features of some routes and tourists. This article presents an Agent-based Simulator (ABS) that covers this gap of the literature and is called Agent-based Simulator for Tourist Urban Routes (ABSTUR). It receives input from a set of routes and certain number of tourists with different types, and provides the number of tourist people signed up for each route after the simulation. ABSTUR has been experienced by assisting a group of tourism experts in designing a set of tourist routes in the historic center of Madrid. In this manner, experts were able to avoid collections of routes with overcrowded or non-profitable routes. ABSTUR has also proven to be efficient by comparing it with another ABS with the same specifications.},

A random sample of 1207 U.S.-based adults with Internet access completed an experiment that manipulated the source, volume, and valence of online movie ratings in order to test predictions derived from these perspectives. Results indicated that ratings volume is positively associated with trust of, reliance on, and confidence in user-generated content, as well as the congruence between one{\textquoteright}s own and others{\textquoteright} opinions; that ratings source and volume interact to impact credibility perceptions, reliance on user-generated information, and opinion congruence, such that people tend to favor experts when there is low information volume, but favor user-generated information under conditions of high information volume; and that people{\textquoteright}s opinions and behavioral intentions converge with the online ratings information to which they are exposed. In addition, these effects apply more strongly to people more conversant with user-generated content. Results indicate important theoretical extensions by demonstrating that social information online may be filtered through signals indicating its veracity, which may not apply equally to all social media users.},

And collaborative filtering techniques have proven to be an vital component of many such recommender systems as they facilitate the generation of high-quality recom-mendations by leveraging the preferences of communities of similar users. In this paper we suggest that the traditional emphasis on user similarity may be overstated. We argue that additional factors have an important role to play in guiding recommendation. Specifically we propose that the trustworthiness of users must be an important consideration. We present two computational models of trust and show how they can be readily incorporated into standard collaborative filtering frameworks in a variety of ways. We also show how these trust models can lead to improved predictive accuracy during recommendation.},

abstract = {This paper is a survey of the algorithms that power recommender systems. To start, the social and monetary relevance of recommender systems is outlined. Then we delve into the specifics of how the first recommender system, Tapestry, coined the idea of numerically defining customer similarity. Moving forward, we show how this central concept of similarity is re-hashed in present day recommender systems, namely that of Amazon.com. Specifically, we examine the complexity of a user-based approach in a large scale system such as Amazon's, identify its weaknesses, and see how these weaknesses are overcome using an item-based approach. The last component of this paper focuses on the Netflix Prize{\texttrademark} and investigates the single most important algorithm in the contest so far: an incremental approach to finding the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a mostly-blank matrix.},

abstract = {Abstract We describe a set of Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT) models for analyzing review and questionnaire data. The basic single culture/cluster model can be used to estimate user competencies, user biases, and aggregate review scores. The model is unsupervised and only utilizes the input review scores. A maximum likelihood approach is used to estimate the model. We expand existing work by developing a clusterwise multi-culture continuous CCT model, for which we use the acronym CONSCLUS (CONSensus CLUStering). The original single culture CCT model is a special one-cluster case of CONSCLUS. We show that when all user competencies are equal, CONSCLUS is equivalent to k-means clustering. CONSCLUS is estimated using an alternating least squares variant of the algorithm for k-means clustering, which we denote as CCT-Means. CONSCLUS is a partitioning clustering technique. We describe extensions to CONSCLUS to incorporate fuzzy clustering and overlapping clustering. We run a series of simulation experiments using generated data with random error. We test both the single cluster and multiple cluster models. These experiments show that CONSCLUS is able to recover aggregate rating values and latent cluster assignments better than a range of other aggregation methods. The performance increase over the other aggregation methods is particularly strong when the users have varying competencies. We give an illustrative example using the Movielens dataset. We give a set of recommendations for the practical implementation of CONSCLUS on real world data and show how the user competencies can be used to gain insight into these data that cannot be gained from simple partitioning clustering.},

Based on this model, in this paper we describe a novel development process for generating CBR systems based on the idea of reusing previous system designs. Template-Based Design (TBD) is the most significant activity in this development process and defines several actors (researcher, developer, student, etc.) involved in the development process of CBR systems with different backgrounds, motivations and goals. The TBD activity is supported by several tools integrated into the COLIBRI Studio Development Environment. These tools rely on semantic descriptions of workflows and components by means of an ontology that supports the reasoning regarding the correctness of the application being generated. We claim that the conceptualization of system behavior into templates and its reuse through the TBD serves to reduce the development effort required to build CBR applications. Thus, we present an experimental evaluation of the viability of the approach.},

abstract = {Abstract Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) use different types of assignments in order to evaluate student knowledge. Multiple-choice tests are particularly apt given the possibility for automatic assessment of large numbers of assignments. However, certain skills require open responses that cannot be assessed automatically yet their evaluation by instructors or teaching assistants is unfeasible given the large number of students. A potentially effective solution is peer assessment whereby students grade the answers of other students. However, to avoid bias due to inexperience, such grades must be filtered. We describe a factorization approach to grading, as a scalable method capable of dealing with very high volumes of data. Our method is also capable of representing open-response content using a vector space model of the answers. Since reliable peer assessment requires students to make coherent assessments, students can be motivated by their assessments reflecting not only their own answers but also their efforts as graders. The method described is able to tackle both these aspects simultaneously. Finally, for a real-world university setting in Spain, we compared grades obtained by our method and grades awarded by university instructors, with results indicating a notable improvement from using a content-based approach. There was no evidence that instructor grading would have led to more accurate grading outcomes than the assessment produced by our models.},

Positioned in the cross-section of the research areas of Interaction Context and Affective Computing current paper investigates if and how context is incorporated in automatic analysis of human affective behavior. Several related aspects are discussed ranging from modeling, acquiring and annotating issues in affectively enhanced corpora to issues related to incorporating context information in a multimodal fusion framework of affective analysis. These aspects are critically discussed in terms of the challenges they comprise while, in a wider framework, future directions of this recently active, yet mainly unexplored, research area are identified. Overall, the paper aims to both document the present status as well as comment on the evolution of the upcoming topic of Context in Affective Computing.},

abstract = {Abstract Vehicular communications will be the next quality step in the development of automotive technologies. Defining these communications is currently in the final step of development, the focus being on standardization and field tests of network devices and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. However, some issues regarding vehicular communications that require a specific research effort are still open and represent a challenge if the technology is to be ultimately implemented and marketed. One of these challenges is to develop effective GeoNetworking in vehicular communications. This concept means that the Vehicle Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET) data package transmission is organized according to the topographical location of the different network nodes (vehicles), with the data flow being organized optimally so as to cover the surroundings of each vehicle. The core of this GeoNetworking system is the GeoRouting algorithm that supports the optimal routing of the data packages and reorganizes the network structure in accordance with the positions of the nodes. In this paper we present a novel GeoRouting algorithm for unicast communications, based on the evolution of the previous results of vehicular mesh networks using IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology. This algorithm has been designed, implemented and validated under controlled conditions and tested in real vehicles on real roads with free-flow traffic. The results suggest that the features of this routing algorithm can be inserted into any vehicular architecture to provide functioning GeoNetworking that will support a wide range of Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) applications.},

abstract = {Recommender systems apply data mining techniques and prediction algorithms to predict users' interest on information, products and services among the tremendous amount of available items. The vast growth of information on the Internet as well as number of visitors to websites add some key challenges to recommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling many recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of participants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data sets. To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering techniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between items and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these relationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies relationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations based on these relationships. In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways to evaluate e?ciency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The paper also analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based techniques for recommendation generation. Moreover, a simple experiment was conducted using a data mining application -Weka- to apply data mining algorithms to recommender system. We conclude by proposing our approach that might enhance the quality of recommender systems.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been widely adopted in online applications to suggest products, services, and contents to potential users. Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful recommendation paradigm that employs transaction information to enrich user and item features for recommendation. By mapping transactions to a bipartite user{\textendash}item interaction graph, a recommendation problem is converted into a link prediction problem, where the graph structure captures subtle information on relations between users and items. To take advantage of the structure of this graph, we propose a kernel-based recommendation approach and design a novel graph kernel that inspects customers and items (indirectly) related to the focal user{\textendash}item pair as its context to predict whether there may be a link. In the graph kernel, we generate random walk paths starting from a focal user{\textendash}item pair and define similarities between user{\textendash}item pairs based on the random walk paths. We prove the validity of the kernel and apply it in a one-class classification framework for recommendation. We evaluate the proposed approach with three real-world datasets. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms, particularly when recommending a large number of items. The experiments show the necessity of capturing user{\textendash}item graph structure in recommendation.},

abstract = {Abstract Collaborative learning incorporates a social component in distance education to minimize the disadvantages of studying in solitude. Frequent analysis of student interactions is required for assessing collaboration. Collaboration analytics arose as a discipline to study student interactions and to promote active participation in e-learning environments. Unfortunately, researchers have been more focused on finding methods to solve collaboration problems than on explaining the results to tutors and students. Yet if students do not understand the results of collaboration analysis methods, they will rarely follow their advice. In this paper we propose a tool that analyzes student interactions and visually explains the collaboration circumstances to provoke the self-reflection and promote the sensemaking about collaboration. The tool presents a visual explanatory decision tree that graphically highlights student collaboration circumstances and helps to understand the reasoning followed by the tool when prescribing a recommendation. An assessment of the tool has demonstrated: (1) the students collaboration circumstances showed by the tool are easy to understand and (2) the students could realize the possible actions to improve the collaboration process.},

abstract = {Abstract Support for component discovery has been identified as a key challenge in various forms of composite application development. In this paper, we describe a general method for component recommendation based on structural similarity of compositions. The method dynamically ranks and recommends components as a composition is incrementally developed. Recommendations are based on structural comparison of the partial composition begin developed with a database of previously completed compositions. Using this method, we define a probabilistic graph edit distance algorithm for component recommendation. We evaluate the accuracy, catalog coverage and response time of the presented algorithm and compare it to a neighborhood-based collaborative filtering approach and two simple statistical algorithms. The evaluation is performed on a Yahoo Pipes dataset and a synthetic dataset that models more complex composite applications. The results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive with the collaborative filtering algorithm in accuracy and outperforms it significantly in coverage. The results on the synthetic dataset suggest that the presented approach can be applied successfully to other composition environments where there is regularity in how components are connected.},

Utilizam a ontologia como forma de aumentar o conhecimento sobre o dom{\'\i}nio.

Middleton, Shadbolt e Roure no trabalho Ontological user profiling in RS (2004) apresentam que a utiliza{\c c}{\~a}o de ontologias de dom{\'\i}nio s{\~a}o eficazes para tratar o problema de cold-start.

A ontoligia deles {\'e} simplismente uma hierarquia de topicos onde estes s{\~a}o utilizados para classificar itens que est{\~a}o sendo recomendados.

Eles tem uma ontologia de referencia da qual todos os perfis dos usuarios derivam. A partir desta cada usu{\'a}rio tem em sua ontologia um conjunto de conceitos derivados da ontologia de referencia com um valor associado ao grau de interesse deste usu{\'a}rio em determinados conceitos.

Eles atualizam o perfil do usu{\'a}rio por Spreading Activation. Com isto eles querem dizer que quando novas avalia{\c c}{\~o}es a algo aparecem, eles buscam os conceitos relacionados a este algo e ent{\~a}o atualizam o perfil do usuario.

Ao inves de utilizar a FC tradicional, eles buscam a similaridade de usuarios pelas suas ontologias. Ou seja, pelas ontologias dos usuarios. Mas, para calcular esta similaridade eles transformam a ontologia em um vetor com as similaridades e ent{\~a}o calculam a distancia entre os usuarios com a distancia euclidiana.

Fazem algumas normaliza{\c c}{\~o}es considerando n{\~a}o apenas a avalia{\c c}{\~o}es explicitas aos itens, mas tamb{\'e}m ao grau de interesse do usu{\'a}rio em um item.

Comparam FC tradicional com o metodos deles. Utilizaram a base de dados do Book-Crossing. Mineraram a Amazon para poder tirar os assuntos dos livros, titulo de categorias que pertencem e outras informa{\c c}{\~o}es.

Os experimentos mostram que o algoritmo deles foi ate melhor que o FC tradiconal. Mas a diferen{\c c}a ficou na casa de poucos cent{\'e}simos para o algoritmos deles. 1.28 -{\&}gt; 1.22...

A significant number of empirical studies have been conducted in the search for knowledge about RE problems as well as evidence of successful and less successful application of proposed solutions. This editorial presents the progress empirical RE research has made since 1992. Based on a search in the Scopus digital library, we report from an analysis of peer-reviewed systematic literature reviews and mapping studies to showcase major areas of RE research that use methods from the Empirical Software Engineering paradigm. We summarize prior empirical research in RE and introduce the contributors to this special issue on empirical research methodologies and studies in RE.},

abstract = {Collective intelligence (CI) is an active field of research, which capitalizes the knowledge of human collectives in order to create, to innovate and to invent. There are two important mechanisms to implement CI: recommender and reputation systems. Recommender systems are used to provide filtered information from a large amount of elements. The recommendations are intended to provide interesting elements to users. Recommendation systems can be developed using different techniques and algorithms where the selection of these techniques depends on the area in which they will be applied. This work presents iPixel Recommender Engine, which is focused on the medical field. iPixel Recommendation Engine supports the process of differential diagnosis by recommending mammographic evaluations. Each mammogram is collectively tagged by the users{\textquoteright} community with a semantic sense; this feature allows iPixel acquires collective knowledge. iPixel can associate more than one feature with each mammogram. This work also presents a qualitative evaluation, where the basic features that a recommendation system should have in the medical field were obtained. Finally, a comparison was carried out with other similar recommender systems in order to know the Pixel advantages.},

Using semantic technologies to represent users{\textquoteright} interests may help to reduce problems such as sparsity, over-specialization and domain-dependency, which are known to be critical issues of state of the art recommenders. In this paper we present a method for high-coverage modeling of Twitter users supported by a hierarchical representation of their interests, which we call a Twixonomy. In order to automatically build a population, community, or single-user Twixonomy we first identify {\textquotedblleft}topical{\textquotedblright} friends in users{\textquoteright} friendship lists (i.e., friends representing an interest rather than a social relation between peers). We classify as topical those users with an associated page on Wikipedia. A word-sense disambiguation algorithm is used to select the appropriate Wikipedia page for each topical friend. Next, starting from the set of wikipages representing the main topics of interests of the considered Twitter population, we extract all paths connecting these pages with topmost Wikipedia category nodes, and we then prune the resulting graph efficiently so as to induce a direct acyclic graph and significantly reduce over ambiguity, a well known problem of the Wikipedia category graph. We release the Twixonomy produced in this work under creative common license.},

Search engines help to solve this problem to some extent but they do not provide personalization of data. Hence, there is a need of recommendation engine. With the help of recommender software the preferences of user for a particular product can be foreseen. Recommender systems help in pinpointing the required information thereby deescalating unwanted information. Collaborative filtering is the most efficient approach to create recommendations so that the identified choices of a user's group can be used to envisage the preferences for other users which are not yet known to them. Through this paper we endeavor to present a thorough survey of collaborative filtering methods that can help in future for further research in this field and thereby propose a solution to enhance the precision and recall measures of recommendations.},

This phenomena is changing the way we live, work, and interact. This creates, not only technological opportunities for smarter cities, but also interactional opportunities for the citizens. However, designing, developing, and deploying urban computing projects in the wild, outside the controlled research environment, is challenging, due to the complexity of the urban context as well as the people who live in it. What are the ways to trigger and increase the public towards active participation or technological uptake in urban computing? How to design and structure participation for urban computing research and technologies in the wild for it to lead to mass participation with its citizens? These are the questions that are investigated in this paper. We present a survey on existing approaches in engaging participations and devising interactions with a range of existing urban computing technologies: smartphones, public displays, cyber physical systems (including those with embedded systems, sensors, and actuators), and Internet of Things. Based on the reviews, we propose a taxonomy for categorising and characterising urban computing technologies and approaches with regards to the level of participation they stimulate, the participation scale they support, the manipulation and effects mode they enable, and the interaction mode and scale they enable. Finally, strategies for structuring and engendering participations and interactions based on our own experience from deploying small to large scale urban computing projects in the wild are presented in this paper.},

abstract = {We present PolyLens, a new collaborative filtering recommender system designed to recommend items for groups of users, rather than for individuals. A group recommender is more appropriate and useful for domains in which several people participate in a single activity, as is often the case with movies and restaurants. We present an analysis of the primary design issues for group recommenders, including questions about the nature of groups, the rights of group members, social value functions for groups, and interfaces for displaying group recommendations. We then report on our PolyLens prototype and the lessons we learned from usage logs and surveys from a nine-month trial that included 819 users We found that users not only valued group recommendations, but were willing to yield some privacy to get the benefits of group recommendations Users valued an extension to the group recommender system that enabled them to invite non-members to participate, via email},

Current approaches require the users to initialize manually their profiles by expressing their interests accurately, which is a very tedious process. We propose a system that automatically infers the users' preferences from their TV viewing histories, i.e., the tourism resources the users might appreciate are selected by considering the TV contents they enjoyed in the past. To this aim, we have developed a context-aware semantics-based recommendation strategy that considers both the users' preferences and the interests of like-minded individuals. The resulting recommendations shape a tailor-made on-move travel plan the users can access via (domestic and) handheld consumer devices(1).},

abstract = {Social media and online services with user-generated content (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube) have made a staggering amount of information (and misinformation) available. Government officials seek to leverage these resources to improve services and communication with citizens. Significant potential exists to identify issues in real time, so emergency managers can monitor and respond to issues concerning public safety. Yet, the sheer volume of social data streams generates substantial noise that must be filtered in order to detect meaningful patterns and trends. Important events can then be identified as spikes in activity, while event meaning and consequences can be deciphered by tracking changes in content and public sentiment. This paper presents findings from a exploratory study we conducted between June and December 2010 with government officials in Arlington, VA (and the greater National Capitol Region around Washington, D.C.), with the broad goal of understanding social media use by government officials as well as community organizations, businesses, and the public at large. A key objective was also to understand social media use specifically for managing crisis situations from the routine (e.g., traffic, weather crises) to the critical (e.g., earthquakes, floods).},

RMAs are deemed to be a candidate blueprint of future online smartphone applications aiming to deliver high functionalities and rich immersive experience to mobile users. RMAs are still in early stages and comprehensive survey of the domain is lacking. In this paper, we use structuralism and functionalism paradigms to analyze RMAs' origins, trends, and characteristics. RMAs are distinguished from traditional mobile applications and Rich Internet Applications (RIAs). Comprehending the distinction between delivering Rich User eXperience (RUX) in desktop and mobile computers, and the inward similarities and dissimilarities between RMAs and RIAs will facilitate and accelerate the development of rich, smartphone-centric applications. We analyze several problems inhibiting the adoption of RMAs and review corresponding solutions to devise a taxonomy. Our study advocates that the majority of problems stem from the intrinsic characteristics of mobile devices and the heterogeneity in this environment, especially when cloud computing is employed to enhance mobile computing. Several open issues on RMAs' domination and adoption are presented as future research directions.},

Especially, it provides more personalized recommendation when the assigned tags belong to more diverse topics.

Users hope to obtain a personalized service which is composed of customized devices among sharable devices in a ubiquitous smart space (which is called USS in this paper). However, the situations of each user are different and user preferences also are various. Although users request the same service in the same USS, the most suitable devices for composing the service are different for each user. For these user requirements, this paper proposes a device recommender system which infers and recommends customized devices for composing a user required service. The objective of this paper is the development of the systems for recommending devices through context-aware inference in peer-to-peer environments. For this goal, this paper considers the context and user preference. Also I implement a prototype system and test performance on the real ubiquitous mobile object (UMO).},

abstract = {Abstract Twitter is often referred to as a backchannel for conferences. While the main conference takes place in a physical setting, on-site and off-site attendees socialize, introduce new ideas or broadcast information by microblogging on Twitter. In this paper we analyze scholars{\textquoteright} Twitter usage in 16 Computer Science conferences over a timespan of five years. Our primary finding is that over the years there are differences with respect to the uses of Twitter, with an increase of informational activity (retweets and URLs), and a decrease of conversational usage (replies and mentions), which also impacts the network structure {\textendash} meaning the amount of connected components {\textendash} of the informational and conversational networks. We also applied topic modeling over the tweets{\textquoteright} content and found that when clustering conferences according to their topics the resulting dendrogram clearly reveals the similarities and differences of the actual research interests of those events. Furthermore, we also analyzed the sentiment of tweets and found persistent differences among conferences. It also shows that some communities consistently express messages with higher levels of emotions while others do it in a more neutral manner. Finally, we investigated some features that can help predict future user participation in the online Twitter conference activity. By casting the problem as a classification task, we created a model that identifies factors that contribute to the continuing user participation. Our results have implications for research communities to implement strategies for continuous and active participation among members. Moreover, our work reveals the potential for the use of information shared on Twitter in order to facilitate communication and cooperation among research communities, by providing visibility to new resources or researchers from relevant but often little known research communities.},

abstract = {Abstract The organized capturing and sharing of knowledge is very important, and a lot of tools, such as wikis, social communities and knowledge-management or e-learning portals, exist for supporting this purpose. The community content- and knowledge-capturing, management and sharing portal of the European project {\textquotedblleft}Realising an Applied Gaming Eco-system{\textquotedblright} (RAGE){\dag}{\dag} www.rageproject.eu combines such tools. The goal of the RAGE project is to boost the collaborative knowledge asset management for software development in European applied gaming (AG) research and development (R{\&}amp;D). To support this process, the so-called RAGE ecosystem implements a portal to support the related asset, content and knowledge exchange between diverse actors in AG communities. Therefore, the community portal in RAGE is designed as a so-called ecosystem and is intended to provide its users different tools for the capturing, management, and sharing of knowledge. In this study, we rely on the term and model definition of spiraling knowledge exchange between explicit and tacit knowledge given by Nonaka and Takeuchi.1 To achieve the goal of extracting, i.e., externalizing and explicitly representing and sharing this knowledge to its users, we propose to generate a taxonomy for faceted search automatically by extracting named entities form the knowledge sources and to classify documents using Support Vector Machines (SVM). In this paper we present our architectural approach for the NLP-based IR concepts and discuss how cloud services based on data distribution and cloud computing can improve the outcome of our system.},

abstract = {Abstract Trust is a main success factor for automated recommendation agents on e-commerce sites. Various aspects can contribute to the development of trust toward such an agent, including perceptions about the usefulness of the recommendations, the transparency of the recommendation process, and the general quality of the website. These factors have been analyzed in isolation in the literature though. We propose and evaluate a new trust model that integrates these factors, and allows us to assess their relative importance for trust-building. We conducted empirical studies in the context of two popular e-commerce websites. The findings suggest that transparency is equally important to consumers for building trust as recommendation quality, and that general we site quality contributes to the development of trust. The findings indicate that focusing on recommendation quality may be insufficient and higher levels of adoption of the recommendations can be achieved when several trust-building factors are considered.},

abstract = {Abstract A modern and successful tackle on education is represented by new teaching techniques which imply online courses, collaborative assignments, dynamic grading systems, real-time feedback and motivational inserts into the process of learning. Elearning together with massive open online courses (MOOCs) have seen a recent rise in popularity and integrate many of the aspects that enable distant students to take part in higher levels of education. While the perspective of migrating towards a pure online environment is in line with the trend of the younger generations, most professional and intellectual skills can only be effectively learned through physical attendance and practical guided work. Yet, the main concern highlighted in this paper is the weak point of most classic educational systems: the constant decreasing motivation it gives students - individuals who have grown and are embedded in many virtual realities form where they draw the needed intrinsic motivation and energy. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an educational platform named Gamified, which simplifies the educational and grading systems in modern schools and universities. It relies on the fundamental aspects of the theory of Gamification, namely bringing motivational elements from (video) games into non-game contexts. It does this through the abandonment of grades (seen by us as negative feedback, a demotivator), and integration of heroes, accumulated experience, levels, level-ups, achievements, quests, guilds, and other representative elements taken from role-playing games (positive feedback at different levels of motivation). Not only do these elements sound familiar to a vast majority of todays students, but they also trigger interest in the new approach to learning. We validate this technique over a period of 3 years on different generations of college students, compare the results with control groups, a present what we believe is remarkable feedback - both in terms of grades and participation, as well as in student attitude towards learning.},

The results indicated that three factors that relate to three dimensions of social capital in the VC {\textendash} familiarity with members in the VC from the structural dimension, perceived similarity with other members from the cognitive dimension, and trust in other members from the relational dimension {\textendash} are all positively related to the sense of belonging, which affects intentions to get and share knowledge and mediates the relationships between social capital factors and a VC member's intentions to participate.},

Different stages imply different preferences and consumer demands. Thus, life stages play an important role in marketing, economics, and sociology.

First, we conducted a large-scale empirical study with 1435 participants and showed that a person{\textquoteright}s mobile app adoption pattern is strongly influenced by her current life stage. Second, we presented a data-driven, highly-scalable, and real-time approach of predicting an individual{\textquoteright}s current life stage based on the apps she has installed on smartphone. Result showed that our predictive models were able to predict life stages with 241.0% higher precision and 148.2% higher recall than a random guess on average.},

The tasks performed in that field are knowledge intensive and can often benefit from using additional knowledge from various sources. Therefore, many approaches have been proposed in this area that combine Semantic Web data with the data mining and knowledge discovery process. This survey article gives a comprehensive overview of those approaches in different stages of the knowledge discovery process. As an example, we show how Linked Open Data can be used at various stages for building content-based recommender systems. The survey shows that, while there are numerous interesting research works performed, the full potential of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data for data mining and KDD is still to be unlocked.},

abstract = {Abstract Mobile social networks represent a convergence between mobile communications and service-oriented paradigms, which are supported by the large availability and heterogeneity of resources and services offered by recent mobile devices. In particular, the service-oriented nature of MSN is in the capability of sharing resources and services among devices that lie in proximity and that opportunistically interact. Service discovery is thus of primary importance to sustain the most intimate mechanisms of MSN. Despite of their centrality, studies on service discovery in MSN are still in their youth. We contribute to frame the results achieved so far and to identify some possible perspectives of the research in this field, by giving a transversal review of the scientific outcomes in the different steps of service discovery, namely advertisement, query, selection and access.},

Ontologies define domain knowledge at a generic level, while problem-solving methods specify generic reasoning knowledge. Both type of components can be viewed as complementary entities that can be used to configure new knowledge systems from existing, reusable components. In this paper, we give an overview of approaches for ontologies and problem-solving methods. 1 Introduction In 1991, the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort [NFF 91] envisioned a new way in which intelligent systems could be built. They proposed the following: "Building knowledgebased systems today usually entails constructing new knowledge bases from scratch. It could be done by assembling reusable components. Systems developers would then only need to worry about creating the specialized knowledge and reasoners new to the specific task of their system. This new system would interoperate with existing systems, us...},

The main aim of learning analytics is to improve learning outcomes and the overall learning process in electronic learning virtual classrooms and computer-supported education. The most basic unit of learning data in virtual learning environments for learning analytics is the interaction, but there is no consensus yet on which interactions are relevant for effective learning. Drawing upon extant literature, this research defines three system-independent classifications of interactions and evaluates the relation of their components with academic performance across two different learning modalities: virtual learning environment (VLE) supported face-to-face (F2F) and online learning. In order to do so, we performed an empirical study with data from six online and two VLE-supported F2F courses. Data extraction and analysis required the development of an ad hoc tool based on the proposed interaction classification. The main finding from this research is that, for each classification, there is a relation between some type of interactions and academic performance in online courses, whereas this relation is non-significant in the case of VLE-supported F2F courses. Implications for theory and practice are discussed next.},

This paper describes the development of a multi-modal proactive recommendation system featuring personalized content combined with the use of car sensors to determine when to present information. A prototype is implemented in a car simulator and trained through user tests. The final system shows a 19% deviation from baseline driving and thereby performs better than comparable systems. This is backed up by user experience data which reports drivers having a positive experience with the system.},

The study was conducted in the context of two European organizations, in which the study participants (N~=~53) used the learning software Learn-B for two months in their regular activities. Data about perceived usefulness of the technological scaffolding interventions and traces about the events of the actual use of the technological interventions and micro-level processes of self-regulated learning were collected and analyzed. The analysis of the data showed that when directly asked about their own perspectives, the participants tended to rely on their organizational context in their planning phase. The results also indicate that the participants did consider the social context of their organization when planning their learning goals, but it was not found as the most influential factor. The analysis of the trace data revealed a moderate balance between reliance on both social and organizational contexts. The analysis of the theorized contingencies via trace data showed that the participants{\textquoteright} usefulness perceptions of the proposed interventions for their self-regulated processes, poorly matched with their actual learning actions.},

This study observed the profile elements of student that contribute to the failures rate of student. There are several factors which are affecting the student behavior such as: relative bond, education schedule, nonattendance, school level of father and mother, period of Voyage and etc. The research that presented in this paper mainly focus on monitoring elements that potential to ruin students performance. Based on the collected data, it will calculate the gap between each factors to measure the flow betwenness and role-influence analysis of students who has high family quality time, free time and gout time tends to High value on efficiency, emergent leader and in the know of influence network. This mean student who has flow great betwenness value among the other will control the flow of network and this person will encourage other member in network and can be act as a leader. It is found that goouttime and freetime as well as study time has strong correlation with catastrophe of study where student that has high flow betwenness tend to spread their influence toward other student. Teacher and School management should aware to this kind of student and take action properly. The result of study is important for learning improvement in the future, whether system or person improvement, so it can drive to better education in the future.},

Ontologies define domain knowledge at a generic level, while problem-solving methods specify generic reasoning knowledge. Both type of components can be viewed as complementary entities that can be used to configure new knowledge systems from existing, reusable components. In this paper, we give an overview of approaches for ontologies and problem-solving methods. 1 Introduction In 1991, the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort [NFF 91] envisioned a new way in which intelligent systems could be built. They proposed the following: "Building knowledgebased systems today usually entails constructing new knowledge bases from scratch. It could be done by assembling reusable components. Systems developers would then only need to worry about creating the specialized knowledge and reasoners new to the specific task of their system. This new system would interoperate with existing systems, us...},

abstract = {Abstract Complex networks have emerged as a simple yet powerful framework to represent and analyze a wide range of complex systems. The problem of ranking the nodes and the edges in complex networks is critical for a broad range of real-world problems because it affects how we access online information and products, how success and talent are evaluated in human activities, and how scarce resources are allocated by companies and policymakers, among others. This calls for a deep understanding of how existing ranking algorithms perform, and which are their possible biases that may impair their effectiveness. Many popular ranking algorithms (such as Google{\textquoteright}s PageRank) are static in nature and, as a consequence, they exhibit important shortcomings when applied to real networks that rapidly evolve in time. At the same time, recent advances in the understanding and modeling of evolving networks have enabled the development of a wide and diverse range of ranking algorithms that take the temporal dimension into account. The aim of this review is to survey the existing ranking algorithms, both static and time-aware, and their applications to evolving networks. We emphasize both the impact of network evolution on well-established static algorithms and the benefits from including the temporal dimension for tasks such as prediction of network traffic, prediction of future links, and identification of significant nodes.},

abstract = {Abstract Recommender systems are tools to suggest items to target users. Accuracy-focused recommender systems tend to recommend popular items, while suggesting items with few ratings (long tail items) is also of great importance in practice. Recommending long tail items may cause an accuracy loss of recommendation results. Thus, it is necessary to have a recommendation framework that recommends unpopular items meanwhile minimizing the accuracy loss. In this paper, we formulate a multi-objective framework for long tail items recommendation. Under this framework, two contradictory objective functions are designed to describe the abilities of recommender system to recommend accurate and unpopular items, respectively. To optimize these two objective functions, a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed. This multi-objective evolutionary algorithm aims to find a set of tradeoff solutions by optimizing two objective functions simultaneously. Experiments show that the proposed framework is effective to suggest accurate and novel items. The proposed recommendation algorithm could suggest many high-quality recommendation lists for the target user based on the concept of Pareto dominance in one run.},

abstract = {Abstract In the context of elections, the Internet opens new and promising possibilities for parties and candidates looking for a better political strategy and visibility. In this way they can also organize their election campaign to gather funds, to mobilize support, and to enter into a direct dialogue with the electorate. This paper presents an ongoing research of recommender systems applied on e-government, particularly it is an extension of so-called voting advice applications (VAA{\textquoteright}s). VAA{\textquoteright}s are Web applications that support voters, providing relevant information on candidates and political parties by comparing their political interests with parties or candidates on different political issues. Traditional VAA{\textquoteright}s provide recommendations of political parties and candidates focusing on static profiles of users. The goal of this work is to develop a candidate profile based on different parameters, such as the perspective of voters, social network activities, and expert opinions, to construct a more accurate dynamic profile of candidates. Understanding the elements that compose a candidate profile will help citizens in the decision-making process when facing a lack of information related to the behavior and thinking of future public authorities. At the end of this work, a fuzzy-based visualization approach for a VAA design is given using as a case study the National Elections of Ecuador in 2013.},

abstract = {Abstract Anomaly intrusion detection in big data environments calls for lightweight models that are able to achieve real-time performance during detection. Abstracting audit data provides a solution to improve the efficiency of data processing in intrusion detection. Data abstraction refers to abstract or extract the most relevant information from the massive dataset. In this work, we propose three strategies of data abstraction, namely, exemplar extraction, attribute selection and attribute abstraction. We first propose an effective method called exemplar extraction to extract representative subsets from the original massive data prior to building the detection models. Two clustering algorithms, Affinity Propagation (AP) and traditional k-means, are employed to find the exemplars from the audit data. k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for the detection. We then employ another two strategies, attribute selection and attribute extraction, to abstract audit data for anomaly intrusion detection. Two http streams collected from a real computing environment as well as the KDD{\textquoteright}99 benchmark data set are used to validate these three strategies of data abstraction. The comprehensive experimental results show that while all the three strategies improve the detection efficiency, the AP-based exemplar extraction achieves the best performance of data abstraction.},

Collaborative Tagging allows users to annotate content of their liking, which via the appropriate algorithms can render useful for the provision of product recommendations. It is the case today for tag-based algorithms to work complementary to rating-based recommendation mechanisms to predict the user liking to various products. In this paper we propose an alternative algorithm for computing personalized recommendations of products, that uses exclusively the tags provided by the users. Our approach is based on the idea of using the semantic similarity of the user-provided tags for clustering them into groups of similar meaning. Afterwards, some measurable characteristics of users{\textquoteright} Annotation Competency are combined with other metrics, such as user similarity, for computing predictions. The evaluation on data used from a real-world collaborative tagging system, citeUlike, confirmed that our approach outperforms the baseline Vector Space model, as well as other state of the art algorithms, predicting the user liking more accurately.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents a high-level overview of mining complex data types, which includes mining sequence data such as time series, symbolic sequences, and biological sequences; mining graphs and networks; and mining other kinds of data, including spatiotemporal and cyber-physical system data, multimedia, text and Web data, and data streams. Trends and research frontiers in data mining are focused on. An overview of methodologies for mining complex data types is presented. Such mining includes mining time-series, sequential patterns, and biological sequences; graphs and networks; spatiotemporal data, including geospatial data, moving-object data, and cyber-physical system data; multimedia data; text data; web data; and data streams. Other approaches to data mining, including statistical methods, theoretical foundations, and visual and audio data mining are briefly introduced. Several well-established statistical methods have been proposed for data analysis such as regression, generalized linear models, analysis of variance, mixed-effect models, factor analysis, discriminant analysis, survival analysis, and quality control. Data mining applications in business and in science, including the financial retail, and telecommunication industries, science and engineering, and recommender systems are introduced. The social impacts of data mining are discussed, including ubiquitous and invisible data mining, and privacy-preserving data mining. Finally, current and expected data mining trends that arise in response to new challenges in the field e speculated.},

PADS employs the standard Open Provenance Model (OPM) specification for capturing provenance data, and stores this data as ontological instances.

We also demonstrate how this data can be used to make useful recommendations to the organizers, in order to manage upcoming research ventures.},

Thus, as result of the selection and analysis of 240 EDM works, an EDM work profile was compiled to describe 222 EDM approaches and 18 tools. A profile of the EDM works was organized as a raw data base, which was transformed into an ad-hoc data base suitable to be mined. As result of the execution of statistical and clustering processes, a set of educational functionalities was found, a realistic pattern of EDM approaches was discovered, and two patterns of value-instances to depict EDM approaches based on descriptive and predictive models were identified. One key finding is: most of the EDM approaches are ground on a basic set composed by three kinds of educational systems, disciplines, tasks, methods, and algorithms each. The review concludes with a snapshot of the surveyed EDM works, and provides an analysis of the EDM strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats, whose factors represent, in a sense, future work to be fulfilled.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide education practitioners with the background and examples needed to understand Bayesian networks and use them to design and implement student models. The student model is the key component of any adaptive tutoring system, as it stores all the information about the student (for example, knowledge, interest, learning styles, etc.) so the tutoring system can use this information to provide personalized instruction. Basic and advanced concepts and techniques are introduced and applied in the context of typical student modeling problems. A repertoire of models of varying complexity is discussed. To illustrate the proposed methodology a Bayesian Student Model for the Simplex algorithm is developed.},

Exploration of the possibilities of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) led to the development of many solutions and recently to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). MOOCs are probably the most important {\textquotedblleft}novelty{\textquotedblright} in the field of e-learning of the last years. MOOCs are capable of providing several ten thousands of learners with access to courses over the web. MOOCs have recently gained much attention especially in leading universities and are now often considered as a highly promising form of teaching. More and more universities are currently working to offer their courses in the form of MOOC providing learners with a wide variety of choices. With MOOCs proliferation, learners will be exposed to various challenges and the traditional problem in TEL {\textquotedblleft}finding the best learning resources{\textquotedblright} is more than ever up to date. Since information retrieval and searching for the appropriate learning resources is an essential activity in TEL, the development of recommender systems for learning has seen increased attention. Recommender systems permit to respond to the traditional problem. In the present paper, we address this major problem {\textendash} the difficulty for learners to find courses which best fit their personal interests. We propose a system that recommends appropriate MOOCs in response to a specific request of the learner. Using the Case Based Reasoning (CBR) approach and a special retrieval information technique, the system proposes to the learners the most appropriate MOOCs (from different providers) fitting her/his request based on learner profile, needs and knowledge.},

abstract = {{\textemdash}Skills-based learning environments are used to promote the acquisition of practical skills as well as decision making, communication, and problem solving. It is important to provide feedback to the students from these sessions and observations of their actions may inform the assessment process and help researchers to better understand the learning process. Through a series of prototype demonstrators, we have investigated the use of semantic annotation in the recording and subsequent understanding of such simulation environments. Our Semantic Web approach is outlined and conclusions drawn as to the suitability of different annotation methods and their combination with ubiquitous computing techniques to provide novel mechanisms for both student feedback and increased understanding of the learning environment.},

What are the most effective ways of choosing a property, when the selection is so vast and complex? An aid is developed here to accomplish this, based on a new advertising format, an iterative method and the NEuro-Advertising Property Video Recommendation System (NEAR). A known methodology involves behavioral operational research and the emotions involved in decision-making. Three advanced research contributions are unique to the proposed method and NEAR, in contrast to innovative behavioral operational research. Firstly, data are compiled for a neuro decision matrix, based on housing attributes and the valence, arousal, emotional state and physiological parameters of a potential real estate buyer. Secondly, the performance of a multiple criteria neuroanalysis occurs as well as the selection of the most personalized and effective video clip ad variants drawn from many alternatives. Finally, NEAR is found to present the most effective video clips ads for real estate buyers for as long a period as possible, according to Multiple Resource Theory.},

abstract = {Abstract Many previous studies on face recognition attempted to seek a precise classifier to achieve a low misclassification error, which is based on an assumption that all misclassification costs are the same. In many real-world scenarios, however, this assumption is not reasonable due to the imbalanced misclassification cost and insufficient high-quality facial image information. To address this issue, we propose a sequential three-way decision method for cost-sensitive face recognition. The proposed method is based on a formal description of granular computing. It develops a sequential strategy in a decision process. In each decision step, it seeks a decision which minimizes the misclassification cost rather than misclassification error, and it incorporates the boundary decision into the decision set such that a delayed decision can be made if available high-quality facial image information is insufficient for a precise decision. To describe the granular information of the facial image in three-way decision steps, we develop a series of image granulation methods based on two-dimensional subspace projection methods including 2DPCA, 2DLDA and 2DLPP. The sequential three-way decisions and granulation methods present an applicable simulation on human decisions in face recognition, which simulate a sequential decision strategy from rough granule to precise granule. The experiments were conducted on two popular facial image database, which validated the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are increasingly touted as an indispensable service of many online stores and websites. Most existing recommendation techniques typically rely on users' historical, long-term interest profiles, derived either explicitly from users' preference ratings or implicitly from their purchasing/browsing history, to arrive at recommendation decisions. In this study, we propose a coauthorship network-based, task-focused literature recommendation technique to meet users' information need specific to a task under investigation and develop three different schemes for estimating the closeness between scholars based on their coauthoring relationships. We empirically evaluate the proposed coauthorship network-based technique. The evaluation results suggest that our proposed technique outperforms the author-based technique across various degrees of content coherence in task profiles. The proposed technique is more effective than the content-based technique when task profiles specified by users are similar in their contents but is less effective otherwise. We further develop a hybrid method that switches between the coauthorship network-based and content-based techniques on the basis of the content coherence of a task profile. It achieves comparable or better recommendation effectiveness, when compared with the pure coauthorship network-based and content-based techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract Cognitive map is a well-known approach to model the dynamics of qualitative systems, and has been studied and used in various fields, such as psychology, education, engineering, and management. Although the validity and usefulness of cognitive maps has been proven in many fields, and a considerable number of cognitive maps have been built during the last decade, cognitive map construction and use was just one-off event. In addition, the high degree of cognitive complexities in large cognitive maps makes it difficult for others to understand and exploit the pre-defined cognitive map in another similar domain problem. In this paper, an ontological semantic inference method, which combines the cognitive map and semantic influence, is proposed. This approach reuses a pre-defined cognitive map and provides an ontological semantic inference mechanism in decision making environments by reducing the degree of cognitive complexities in a large cognitive map.},

abstract = {Social networks are growing in number and size, with hundreds of millions of user accounts among them. One added benefit of these networks is that they allow users to encode more information about their relationships than just stating who they know. In this work, we are particularly interested in trust relationships, and how they can be used in designing interfaces. In this paper, we present FilmTrust, a website that uses trust in webbased social networks to create predictive movie recommendations. Using the FilmTrust system as a foundation, we show that these recommendations are more accurate than other techniques when the user's opinions about a film are divergent from the average. We discuss this technique both as an application of social network analysis, as well as how it suggests other analyses that can be performed to help improve collaborative filtering algorithms of all types.},

abstract = {Abstract Big data has become an important issue for a large number of research areas such as data mining, machine learning, computational intelligence, information fusion, the semantic Web, and social networks. The rise of different big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and, more recently, Spark, for massive data processing based on the MapReduce paradigm has allowed for the efficient utilisation of data mining methods and machine learning algorithms in different domains. A number of libraries such as Mahout and SparkMLib have been designed to develop new efficient applications based on machine learning algorithms. The combination of big data technologies and traditional machine learning algorithms has generated new and interesting challenges in other areas as social media and social networks. These new challenges are focused mainly on problems such as data processing, data storage, data representation, and how data can be used for pattern mining, analysing user behaviours, and visualizing and tracking data, among others. In this paper, we present a revision of the new methodologies that is designed to allow for efficient data mining and information fusion from social media and of the new applications and frameworks that are currently appearing under the {\textquotedblleft}umbrella{\textquotedblright} of the social networks, social media and big data paradigms.},

Ratings/ranking provides an efficient and effective way to build trust relationship among faculties and students in e-learning environment. Content driven reputation systems is based on the feedback provided by analysis of all interactions whereas user driven reputation systems is based only on the feed-back or ratings provided by the users. Z-score is the popular ranking calculating method which compares sample with population or 2 samples, paired or unpaired. ANOVA/F tests are similar to Z-score but use variances instead of means and can be applied to more than 2 groups and other more complex scenarios. This paper includes the online rating calculation method, Bayesian Approximation, for reputation management and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain as a metric for measuring ranking correctness.},

So far, many studies considering only one OSN or, at most, comparing results obtained for a single OSN, have been provided. Nowadays, users typically join more OSNs and this is an important aspect that should be taken into account for user behavior analysis. In this paper, we give an important contribution in this direction, by analyzing the behavior of users belonging to both Facebook and Twitter. This way, the analysis is well-founded because it is conducted on a common set of users and, further, a number of specific analyses become possible (as common friendship). Our study is carried out on data extracted from the web, and allows us to find important specificities of these users about their privacy setting, the choice of friends and the activity they do, which are generally consistent with the recent findings in this field.},

Our method, implemented in an actual system, CineCubes, includes the following steps. The user submits a query over an underlying star schema. Taking this query as input, the system comes up with a set of queries complementing the information content of the original query, and executes them. For each of the query results, we execute a set of highlight extraction algorithms that identify interesting patterns and values in the data of the results. Then, the system visualizes the query results and accompanies this presentation with a text commenting on the result highlights. Moreover, via a text-to-speech conversion the system automatically produces audio for the constructed text. Each combination of visualization, text and audio practically constitutes a movie, which is wrapped as a PowerPoint presentation and returned to the user.},

This study investigated constraints imposed on social interactions by the algorithm, by triggering participants{\textquoteright} awareness of {\textquotedblleft}missed posts{\textquotedblright} in their Friends{\textquoteright} Timelines that they did not remember seeing before. If the algorithm prioritizes posts from people that users feel closer to and want to stay in touch with, participants should be less likely to report missed posts from close Friends. However, the results showed that relationship closeness had no effect on the likelihood of noticing a missed post, after controlling for how many Facebook Friends participants had and the accuracy of participants{\textquoteright} memories for their Friends{\textquoteright} Facebook activity. Also, missed posts from close Friends were more surprising, even when participants believed that the actions of the system caused the missed posts, indicating that these instances represent participants{\textquoteright} unmet expectations for the behavior of their News Feeds. Because Facebook posts present opportunities for feedback important for social support and maintaining social ties, this could indicate bias in the way the algorithm promotes content that could affect users{\textquoteright} ability to maintain relationships on Facebook. These findings have implications for approaches to improve user control and increase transparency in systems that use algorithmic filtering.},

abstract = {AbstractContext In Global Systems Engineering teams, researchers have found that trust can be transitive to some degree or imported (swift trust) under certain conditions. We argue that trust can be contagion and seeded by tools (spread from one individual to another through tools). Objective We sought to investigate the potential for using tools to support the development of trust in such teams and facilitate contagion trust. Specifically, we sought to investigate whether any existing tools support the development of trust in such teams and which information helps such development, whether the visualization of past collaborations would help developing trust, and what tools or features practitioners would wish for, if they had a magic wand. Method We interviewed 71 employees from five multinational organizations. We focused on gaining an understanding of the tools that are currently used to engender trust and the information needed to facilitate contagion, in which conditions visualizations of past collaborations are helpful, and what software tool features could help develop trust. Our analysis was guided by grounded theory. Results We found evidence that supports the theory of contagion trust and tools can be used to initiate the development of trust. These tools include software tools, office technologies, or organizational structures. Practitioners{\textquoteright} needs were functional (e.g. audio channel with remote colleagues) and/or non-functional (e.g. can be adopted in sites with poor infrastructure). Conclusion Our study illustrates that tools can be used to facilitate contagion trust and provides three main contributions. First, our exploration of how existing tools are used provides a guide to effective practices in such teams. Second, the descriptions of features that can facilitate contagion trust provide useful design implications for future tools. Third, the identification of the kind of information that facilitates contagion trust provides an understanding of practitioners{\textquoteright} underlying needs that can be used to develop collaboration tools.},

abstract = {Abstract Nowadays, the increasing demand for group recommendations can be observed. In this paper we address the problem of recommendation performance for groups of users (group recommendation). We focus on the performance of very Top-N recommendations, which are important when recommending the long lasting items (only a few such items are consumed per session, e.g. movie). To improve existing group recommenders we propose a mixed hybrid recommender for groups combining content-based and collaborative strategies. The principle of proposed group recommender is to generate content and collaborative recommendations for each user, apply an aggregation strategy to solve the group conflict preferences for the content and collaborative sets separately, and finally reorder the collaborative candidates based on the content-based ones. It is based on an idea that candidates recommended by both recommendation strategies at the same time are presumably more appropriate for the group than the candidates recommended by individual strategies. The evaluation is performed by several experiments in the multimedia domain (as typical representative for group recommendations). Both, online and offline experiments were performed in order to compare real users{\textquoteright} satisfaction to the standard group recommenders and also, to compare performance of proposed approach to the state-of-the-art recommenders based on the MovieLens dataset. Finally, we experimented with the proposed hybrid recommender to generate the recommendation for a group of size one (i.e. single user recommendation). Obtained results, support our hypothesis that proposed mixed hybrid approach improves the precision of the recommendation for groups of users and for the single-user recommendation respectively on very Top-N recommended items.},

The method combines both connectivity-based and channel-based features with a selection method that considerably reduces the dimensionality of the data and allows for an efficient classification. In particular, the Relative Energy (RE) and its logarithm in the spacial domain, and the Spectral Power (SP) in the frequency domain are computed for the four typical frequency bands ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\theta$), and complemented with the Mutual Information measured over all channel pairs. The resulting features are then reduced by using a hybrid method that combines supervised and unsupervised feature selection. First, Welch{\textquoteright}s t-test is used to select the features that best separate the classes, and discard the ones that are less useful for classification. To this end, all features where the t-test yields a p-value above a threshold are eliminated. The remaining ones are further reduced by using Principal Component Analysis. Detection results are compared to state-of-the-art methods on DEAP, a database for emotion analysis composed of labeled recordings from 32 subjects while watching 40 music videos. The effect of using different classifiers is also evaluated, and a significant improvement is observed in all cases.},

This paper presents the most common difficulties encountered by newcomers to the language, that have been observed during the course of more than a dozen work- shops, tutorials and modules about OWL-DL and it{\textquoteright}s predecessor languages. It emphasises understanding the exact meaning of OWL expressions {\textendash} proving that understanding by paraphrasing them in pedantic but explicit language. It ad- dresses, specifically, the confusion which OWL{\textquoteright}s open world assumption presents to users accustomed to closed world systems such as databases, logic program- ming and frame languages. Our experience has had a major influence in formulat- ing the requirements for a new set of user interfaces for OWL the first of which are now available as prototypes. A summary of the guidelines and paraphrases and examples of the new interface are provided. The example ontologies are available online.},

A unique internet banking usage model (IBUM) was developed and validated. The initial proposed model incorporated 10 factors named usefulness, ease of use, control, social influence, compatibility, risk, website features, alliance service, awareness of service and personalization that affect internet banking usage. The initial model was tested against both measurement and structural models. The results of initial model testing indicated that compatibility has the most significant effect on internet banking usage which is then followed by alliance service, usefulness, personalization and ease of use. Consequently, the initial model was modified in order to find the inter-relationships among factors. The final IBUM consists of 7 factors which are able to explain 65% of the variance in internet banking usage. Finally, the results are discussed and suggestions for future researches presented by highlighting the effects of personalization and alliance services.},

In this paper we analyze 3 million real-world SPARQL queries extracted from logs of the DBPedia and SWDF public endpoints. We aim at finding which are the most used language elements both from syntactical and structural perspectives, paying special attention to triple patterns and joins, since they are indeed some of the most expensive SPARQL operations at evaluation phase. We have determined that most of the queries are simple and include few triple patterns and joins, being Subject-Subject, Subject-Object and Object-Object the most common join types. The graph patterns are usually star-shaped and despite triple pattern chains exist, they are generally short.},

Recommendations can be used to overcome current limitations of learning management systems in providing personalization and accessibility features. Recommenders can take advantage of standards-based solutions to provide inclusive support. To this end we have identified the need for developing semantic educational recommender systems, which are able to extend existing learning management systems with adaptive navigation support. In this paper we present three requirements to be considered in developing these semantic educational recommender systems, which are in line with the service-oriented approach of the third generation of learning management systems, namely: (i) a recommendation model; (ii) an open standards-based service-oriented architecture; and (iii) a usable and accessible graphical user interface to deliver the recommendations.},

abstract = {Technology Enhanced Learning is a research field that has matured considerably over the last decade. Many technical solutions to support design, authoring and use of learning activities and resources have been developed. The first datasets that reflect the tracking of actual use of these tools in real-life settings are beginning to become available. In this article, we present an exploratory study that relies on these datasets to support semi-automatic assembly of learning activities and resources for specific contexts. Starting from learning designs and other online sources that describe well designed learning experiences as they were used in practice, we derive sequencing patterns that capture re-occurring patterns of activities. A semi-automatic assembly framework uses these patterns to support teachers in the design and authoring of course activities. We present a case study that integrates recommendation support for sequencing activities as well as associated resources in the LAMS learning activity environment. Results indicate that the perceived usefulness is high: both teachers with expertise in the use of learning design tools as well as teachers with no background knowledge in the area indicate that the recommendations helped them in the authoring process. In addition, they feel more confident using learning design tools when support is provided that is driven by best practice knowledge.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have successfully supported the effective and efficient selection of one product out of the many which meet consumer's needs. Our work extends this work to the area of service recommendation, where we demonstrate the need for using multiple criteria regarding service qualities, and the need to consider multiple contextual dimensions regarding the expected use of that service. This motivates our proposed approach, which uses collaborative filtering and considers both multiple ranking criteria and a number of different context dimensions. The expected sparsity of ranking when handling the contextual information is dealt with by introducing the metric of concept similarity for different context types, and showing how this metric can help reuse data between contexts. At the end of the paper, two rounds of experiments are described. The first shows that considering context produces better predictions, and the second round is used to test our approach for handling sparsity by reusing data between contexts using the similarity metric.},

Abstract This article provides an overview of the use of new technologies for lifelong learning. While in the past learning technologies were mostly provided by educational institutions to support a specific lifetime or shorter learning episodes, nowadays more personal technologies are used for lifelong learning to support self-organized learning. Four important developments are introduced in this article, namely, open learner models and learning analytics, learning networks and networked learning, open educational resources and practices, and last but not least, mobile and contextualized learning. The state of the art in these research fields is summarized and the future potential and requirements for lifelong learning are highlighted.},

abstract = {Many current e-commerce systems provide personalization when their content is shown to users. In this sense, recommender systems make personalized suggestions and provide information of items available in the system. Nowadays, there is a vast amount of methods, including data mining techniques that can be employed for personalization in recommender systems. However, these methods are still quite vulnerable to some limitations and shortcomings related to recommender environment. In order to deal with some of them, in this work we implement a recommendation methodology in a recommender system for tourism, where classification based on association is applied. Classification based on association methods, also named associative classification methods, consist of an alternative data mining technique, which combines concepts from classification and association in order to allow association rules to be employed in a prediction context. The proposed methodology was evaluated in some case studies, where we could verify that it is able to shorten limitations presented in recommender systems and to enhance recommendation quality.},

First, we propose the operationalization of the concepts of motivation and meaning as push{\textendash}pull factors when choosing a destination. Second, an ontology-based clustering method is presented, which makes it possible to analyse these qualitative factors from a semantic perspective to obtain tourist segments. A benchmark confirms that the segmentation obtained is better than that generated using classic clustering methods The results show that different meanings can be associated with any single place.},

Ontologies define domain knowledge at a generic level, while problem-solving methods specify generic reasoning knowledge. Both type of components can be viewed as complementary entities that can be used to configure new knowledge systems from existing, reusable components. In this paper, we give an overview of approaches for ontologies and problem-solving methods. 1 Introduction In 1991, the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort [NFF 91] envisioned a new way in which intelligent systems could be built. They proposed the following: "Building knowledgebased systems today usually entails constructing new knowledge bases from scratch. It could be done by assembling reusable components.

abstract = {Abstract In the literature, several researches on food recommendation and automatic menu generation have been proposed, taking into account different aspects, such as personal and cultural preferences, health and religion constraints, menu composition and recipe co-occurrence. However, recommending recipes and menus, which not only meet the user's preferences, but are also compliant with best food habits, is still an open issue. This paper presents the PREFer food recommender system, apt to provide users with personalized and healthy menus, taking into account both user's short/long-term preferences and medical prescriptions. Prescriptions classify the ideal user's nutrition behaviour from the health point of view, with constraints imposed by the specific user's phenotype. In fact, major novel contribution of the proposed system is the use of prescription types associated with users' profiles to improve users' behaviour in selecting food. The recommended menus are generated through three steps. First, according to user's request, recipes are selected by content-based filtering, based on comparisons among features used to annotate both users' profiles and recipes. Second, candidate menus are generated using the selected recipes. Third, menus are refined and ranked taking into account also prescriptions. The PREFer system has been developed within a regional project, related to the main topics {\textquotedblleft}Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life{\textquotedblright} of the 2015 World Exposition (EXPO2015, Milan, Italy), where the University of Brescia aimed at promoting healthy behavioural habits in nutrition.},
